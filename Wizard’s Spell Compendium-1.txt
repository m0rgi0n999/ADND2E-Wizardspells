Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
(Alteration, Necromancy) (Water)
Level: 8
Range: 20 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 30-ft. cube
Saving Throw: 4
This spell evaporates moisture from the bodies of every living creature within the area of effect, inflicting 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 16d8. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of —2 to their saving throws.
The material component is a bit of sponge.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (ToM).

Absorption
(Abjuration, Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to absorb and redirect magical energy, up to ten spell levels. The incoming spell is nullified and its energy is stored for later use. Any type of spell can be absorbed, except for the following: area spells not targeted directly at the caster, touch attack spells, and the effects of magical devices. Priest spells, any spell scroll, and any spell-like ability use can be absorbed.
At any time during the spell's duration, the caster can expend stored energy to cast a currently memorized spell, without wiping it from his memory. This has a casting time of 1. For example, a wizard absorbing a feeblemind spell (Sth level) releases a lightning bolt (3rd level), has two levels of energy available, and can absorb five more levels of spell energy before the capacity of the spell is completely used. Unused energy and storage capacity are lost when the spell ends.
If an incoming spell exceeds the remaining capacity of the absorption spell, the caster gains a +2 bonus to his saving throw for each incoming spell level that is absorbed, even against spells that normally allow no saving throw. A roll of 1 always fails, regardless of the total of the modifiers.
The caster can voluntarily suppress the absorption for a round in order to receive beneficial spells, but cannot absorb hostile spells in that round.
The spell requires an amulet worth at least 1,000 gp, which must be kept on the caster's person for duration of the spell. The amulet glows when spell energy is stored. It can be reused.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Accelerate Animal Growth
(Chronomancy)
Reversible
Level: 5
Range: 10 ft/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: Neg.
Upon casting this spell, the chronomancer manipulates time with respect to a creature of animal intelligence (1). A creature ages up to one month per level of the chronomancer. The amount of aging must be decided before the spell is cast. Aging occurs at a rate of one month per turn. The creature must make a system shock check at 85% (+1%/Hit Die of the animal, to 99%) or die within 1d4 rounds. Any actions (combat, flight, and so on) the creature takes during the process occur at half its normal ability (attacks as if at half its Hit Dice and loses half its attacks, movement base is halved, and so on). This spell does not allow the creature to exceed its natural size.
The material component necessary for this spell is a piece of bio-matter from the type of animal to be affected. If the chronomancer touches the animal during the spell, no material component is required.
The reverse of this spell, reverse animal growth, reduces the age of the affected creature by up to one month per caster's level to a minimum age of one month. The amount of change must be decided before the spell is cast, and the reversal occurs at a rate of one month every two turns. The rules for the material component are the same.
Notes: Common for chronomancers; otherwise very rare.

Accelerate Erosion
Reversed form, see sands of time.

Accelerate Lifeline
(Chronomancy)
Reversible
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell speeds the aging process of any creature of Intelligence 2 or greater. The creature ages up to one year per level of the chronomancer. The exact amount must be set to the nearest month before the spell is cast. Aging occurs at a rate of one year per turn and a system shock roll to avoid death is required. While undergoing the change, any action attempted is performed at one-half normal ability.
The material component is a small piece of polished amber and an ounce of ichor from a tether beast. The affected creature must be touched, and it receives a saving throw vs. death magic if unwilling.
The reverse of this spell, reverse lifeline, cannot bring back the dead, but it can reduce the age of the recipient by up to one year per level of the caster. Age reduction occurs at a rate of one year per turn, and a system shock roll to avoid death is required. The creature must still be touched, and it receives a save if unwilling. The material components are the same as above, plus a cup of pure spring water subjected to the Demuplane of Time for one subjective day.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Accelerate Plant Growth
(Chronomancy)
Reversible
Level: 2
Range: 10 ft./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Areaof Effect: 100 sq. ft./level maximum
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, it manipulates time to accelerate the aging of plants. This does not allow them to grow beyond their natural size. The area of effect is up to a maximum of 100 square fect per caster's level, and the spell can affect either all plant life or be limited to only one type of plant in that area. The caster can accelerate the growth of plant life by up to one month per level.
The actual amount of aging (to the nearest week) must be decided before the spell is cast. Aging occurs at a rate of one month per turn. If the normal cycle of the plant is exceeded (for a seasonal crop or biannual flower), the plant life withers and dies. This spell is in high demand when early winters or harsh summers threaten crops.
A material component is necessary only if the caster wishes to affect one type of plant. A sample of that plant type is then required.
The reverse of this spell, reverse plant growth, cannot bring back plants that have completely died. It can reverse the aging of live plants by up to one month per level of the chronomancer, the total age reversed being set before the spell is cast. Reverse aging occurs at a rate of one month every two turns A popular use is to get second harvests, but this can be done only with plants that exist year round (fruit trees, berry bushes). The same rule on material components applies.
Notes: Common for chronomancers; otherwise very rare.

Accelerate Metabolism
(Chronomancy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 turn/level + 1-6 turns
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows for natural healing by speeding up the life processes of the subject. Life processes (sleeping, eating, healing) progress at a rate of1 day per turn for the duration of the spell. The creature cannot move or fight any faster than normal. If the creature is unwilling, a saving throw vs. spell is allowed to negate the effect.
Seven rounds per turn must be spent eating and drinking a day's rations, the other three rounds must be spent resting. If insufficient nourishment is provided, the creature suffers from thirst and starvation. If insufficient rest is taken, exhaustion results and no healing occurs.
The creature regains 1 hit point per turn for the first seven turns (minus any penalty due to poor Constitution). In subsequent multiples of seven turns, those with Constitution bonuses recetve the Constitution hit point bonus as additional healing. In any case, 28 turns of accelerated metabolism heal an individual completely, but age the creature a week (as opposed to a day), due to the stresses of the artificially high metabolic rate.
The material component for this spell is a candle, which must be lit at both ends. The candle must burn for the duration of the spell; if it is extinguished, the spell ends prematurely. The candle is completely burned if the spell runs its normal course.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; very rare.

Accuracy
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Geometry)
Reversible
Level: 1
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 missile/level
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, a wu jen can temporarily enchant missiles, both normal and magical, to improve the chance of hitting distant targets. Missiles that can be so enchanted include all items that can be discharged or thrown by a normal man-sized creature. A bundle of arrows could be so enchanted, but the bolt fired by a ballista could not. Likewise, a stone thrown bya giant is not affected by this spell nor could the boulder thrown by an individual wearing a girdle of giant strength be affected.
Upon casting the spell, the missile is enchanted and glows faintly, making it easy to distinguish from normal missiles. For the duration of the spell, all range categories for the missile are double their normal range. Thus, an arrow fired from a daikyu (great bow) would have ranges in yards of 140 (short), 280 (medium), and 420 (long) instead of the normal 70, 140, and 210 yards. This improves the accuracy of the missile since the range modifiers may be less than those that would normally apply. The enchantment remains on the missile until the duration ends. It is possible that a missile fired at an opponent could be fired back, if it could be easily found.
The spell requires brush and ink, which are used to write a mystical character on each missile so enchanted.
The reverse of this spell, inaccuracy, is cast upona creature, not a missile. For the duration of the spell, all missiles fired at that creature are treated as if the target were one range category farther away than it actually is. Short range becomes medium range, medium range becomes long range, and a long range target is considered out of range. A thick piece of ground glass is required for the reverse of the spell.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Acid Bolt
(Evocation)
(Alchemy)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 or 2 creatures
Saying Throw: None
This spell summons two teardrop-shaped bolts of flesh-corrosive force that dart forth from the caster's hands to strike their targets unerringly. Each target must bea single creature that the caster can see and distinguish from others during casting. Once hurled, a bolt will follow a fleeing target out of the caster's view and dodge around obstacles and other creatures, even those who move to intercept it, The caster cannot aim the bolts at specific body parts, areas, or carried items.
Any being struck by an acid bolt suffers 444 points of damage. Skeletal or noncorporeal undead and nonliving objects (even wood and cloth) are unaffected by an acid bolt.
Notes: Rare spell. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Acid Bolt — Drow
(Conjuration)
Level: 4
Range: 200 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous + 1 rd./3 levels
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The caster creates a continuous, straight stream of shimmering liquid that emerges from the caster's hand, and can be aimed, using the caster's attack roll to attain a "direct hit." On impact, the bolt forms a 10-foot radius sphere of acid, and explodes outward in a burst of liquid.
Creatures in the sphere of acid suffer 4d4 damage and each exposed item they wear or carry must make a saving throw vs. acid. Creatures hit by the sphere take damage for multiple rounds, unless the acid is somehow neutralized. The continuing effect is an additional 1d4 points of acid damage per three levels of the caster per round. The effect lasts 1 round for every three experience levels of the caster. Thus a 1 0th-level caster's acid bolt lasts for a maximum of three additional rounds, inflicting 3d4 additional points of acid damage per round. The acid can be countered by dousing the victim in at least a half gallon of water, wine, or similar liquid, or other measures deemed sufficient by the DM.
Creatures struck by splashes from the acid bolt (any creature within a 20-foot radius danger zone) take 2d4 points of acid splash damage. Splash damage is only taken for the round in which the bolt strikes and generally won't require item saving throws.
The material components of this spell are spittle from the caster, a dart, thorn, needle, or icicle, a crystal or glass sphere of any size, and a clear glass vial of acid.
Notes: Common for drow; otherwise rare.

Acid Lash
(Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 3 rds.
Area of Effect: Creates 1 lash
Saving Throw: None
This spell brings into being a vivid, purple, radiant line ofmagical force projecting from one of the caster's hands. Weightless, it crackles and wavers constantly, yet always projects straight out from the caster's forearm, like a lance. An acid lash is 7 feet in length. It rebounds from solid barriers that restrict its full length, bending in random directions. This poses no harm to the wielder. The caster of an acid lash cannot be harmed by it.
An acid lash can be swept back and forth to strike opponents. It bends around solid bodies that it is pulled through, passing easily. Though most casters employ an acid lash against a single opponent, it can deal damage to any number of foes—or friendly beings, for that matter—in certain situations. For example, it can be held across a doorway to harm all who pass through, or thrust directly out at charging foes.
An acid lash has no solidity; it is actually a corrosive field that deals 4d4 points of damage (8d4 to undead). The lash strikes with a THAC0 of 14 because of the ease of striking foes with a sidewise, sweeping motion, but even if the lash is cut across a foe and back many times during a round, 4d4 points of damage is all that is dealt to a given being in a single round. The corrosive field is not hampered by armor, but as it is not true acid, it does no harm to armor, other metal, or even leathers.
While employing an acid lash, the caster cannot directly wield any two-handed weapon or any item larger than a dagger (held or thrown) in the other hand, and cannot cast any spell having a somatic component. An acid lash can be banished instantly by a silent act of will if the caster desires.
The material components of an acid lash are at least three drops of any acidic liquid.
Notes: Rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Acid Rain — Red Wizard
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: 3-ft. diam./level circle
Saving Throw: 1/2
This spell creates an intense storm of burning, corrosive acid over a circle 3 feet in diameter for each level of the caster (a 12th-level wizard can cast the spell in a 36-foot diameter circle). The acid inflicts 6d4+6 points of damage per round as long as the target remains within the area of effect. In addition, exposed equipment must save vs. acid each round that it is in contact with the spell, or be destroyed.
The material component of this spell is a vial of strong acid.
Notes: Restricted to the Red Wizards of Thay or those trained by them; common.

Acid Storm
(Evocation)
(Alchemy, Water)
Level: 7
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 rd./level
Areaof Effect: 20 ft. radius, up to 20 ft. high
Saving Throw: 1/2
This deadly spell unleashes a downpour of magical, gelatinous acid droplets. All creatures within the area of effect are coated by globs of gooey acid. The acid can be washed off only with wine, vinegar, or by a successfull dispel magic or similar spell. The acid remains present for 1 round per level of the caster, then vanishes.
Creatures coated by the acid suffer 1d4 hit points of damage each round during rounds 1-3, 1d6 points in each of rounds 4-6, and 1d8 points on each round thereafter. Creatures that successfully save vs. spell during the first round suffer only half damage from the acid for the remaining rounds. When the spell expires, no further damage is inflicted. Acid damage can be healed through any means except regeneration.
The material component is a drop of acid.
Notes: Uncommon spell (ToM).

Adhesion
(Alteration)
(Alchemy)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 2 objects
Saving Throw: Special
This dweomer causes two solid objects to adhere to one another for the duration of the spell. The caster must touch the juncture between the objects while intoning the spell. The adhered objects can be separated by a successful bend bars/lift gates check, by means of a dispel magic spell, or by exerting a force of more than 1,000 pounds plus 100 pounds per caster level (about two horsepower at Ist level). If the spell is employed against materials or objects worn or carried by an unwilling creature, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
The material component is a pinch of powdered horse's hoof.
Notes: Uncommon spell. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Advanced Illusion
(Iusion/Phantasm)
Level: 5
Range: 60 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: One 40-ft. cube + one 10-ft.
cube/level
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is essentially a spectral forces spell that operates through a program (similar to a programmed illusion spell) determined by the caster. Itis thus unnecessary for the wizard to concentrate on the spell for longer than the round of casting it, as the program has then started and will continue without supervision. The illusion has visual, audio, olfactory, and thermal components. If any viewer actively attempts to disbelieve the spell, he gains a saving throw vs. spell. If any viewer successfully disbelieves and communicates this fact to other viewers, each such viewer gains a saving throw vs. spell with a +4 bonus.
The material components are a bit of fleece and several grains of sand.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Aerial Acceleration — Dragon
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
Although developed by dragons, aerial acceleration can affect any single flying creature, either natural or empowered by magic, touched by the casting dragon. This spell reduces air friction, increasing a creature's flying movement rate by 50%, Thus, a dragon with a movement rate of 24 can fly at 36 for the spell's duration. While flying at this increased speed, however, the dragon's maneuverability class (MC) worsens one step, and special aerial maneuvers (for example, snatch) are impossible. The dragon is not required to move at the increased rate, and may slow to overcome the spell's drawbacks. Aerial acceleration cannot be cancelled at will, but a successful dispel magic or a more powerful spell can force it to end prematurely. Dragons typically use this spell before an aerial battle to increase their odds of catching opponents by surprise or, if things go awry, as a way to outdistance pursuers. Inventive dragons may find other uses for the spell.
Nondragon spellcasters may have converted aerial acceleration to their own use, and versions unrelated to dragon magic may have been devised independently by several wizards, These spells are of higher level, for the draconic version depends heavily on a dragon's innate ability to visualize flight patterns and air currents.
At the DM's discretion, dragons who employ this spell regularly might be considered expert flyers, and thus might retain their normal maneuverability class and aerial tactics. This should be the exception and not the rule.
Notes: Restricted to dragons; uncommon (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Affect Normal Fires
(Alteration)
(Alchemy, Fire)
Level: 1
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to cause nonmagical fires—from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as the area of effect—to reduce in size and brightness to become mere coals or increase in light to become as bright as full daylight and increase the illumination to double the normal radius. Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire.
The caster can affect any or all fires in the spell's area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elementals or similar creatures.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Afterclap
(Alteration)
(Chronomancy)
Level: 8
Range: 10 ft-/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to duplicate the damage suffered by a single creature within spell range on the previous round. Damage is precisely duplicated in type and amount—in other words, the same damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and so on occur in the same way as in the previous round. The damage may have been caused by any source, not just magical attacks.
For example, an evil fighter is struck by two arrows, taking 3 and 4 points of damage, parries a thrust by a ranger with a sword of sharpness, is backstabbed by athief with weakly poisoned dagger (missing the saving throw vs. poison and taking 15 points of damage), and takes more 11 points of damage after making his saving throw against a finger of death spell, all in the same round that a wizard casts afterclap against him. The next round, the fighter takes another 33 points of damage from the afterclap (3 + 4+ 15 + 11 = 33), in addition to whatever damage his enemies inflict.
The material component of an afterclap is a bit of stiff rubber or gum that is pulled until it snaps back.
Notes: Very rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting and for chronomancers; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Agannazar's Scorcher
(Evocation)
(Fire)
Level: 2
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: jet 2 ft. wide x 60 ft. long
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one creature or object of the caster's choice. The target will be hit by the flame for 346 points of damage in the first round and 3d6 points the following round if it remains within the spell' s range. The target has no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage.
Other creatures in the path of the flame jet can make a saving throw vs. spell to avoid 2d8 points of fire damage. A successful saving throw reduces this to 1d8 points of damage.
The caster cannot perform other actions during the second round of the spell or discontinue the spell until it has run its course. If the target moves more than 60 feet away from the caster or takes shelter behind some large fireproof object in the second round, the flame jet will remain directed toward its original target even though no further damage can be caused. Like the burning hands spell, flammable materials such as cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, and so forth in its path will burn, but can be extinguished in the next round if no other action is taken.
Notes: Rare or very rare spell. Known to be in the Tome of the Covenant.

Age Animal
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: Special
This spell can be used only on animals, including giant types and minimals. It instantly ages the animal by as much or little as the caster desires, up to one year per level of the spellcaster. The wizard must make a saving throw vs. spell when the spell is cast; failure means the wizard ages by as many months as the creature ages years.
The spell is most often used to age the subjects of breeding experiments, as it has less chance of adversely affecting the offspring than less subtle dweomers,
Notes: Rare spell. (Updated from IMAGINE Magazine.)

Age to Destruction — Ninja
(Alteration, Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 2 ft./level
Components: S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 object (3 cubic ft.)
Saving Throw: Neg.
With this spell, the ninja can age any nonliving material (of a maximum volume of 3 cubic feet) by about 100 years. An object affected by the spell makes an item saving throw vs. disintegration to avoid the spell's effect.
An object that fails its saving throw suffers the ravages of a hundred years of aging, on the inside. On the outside it appears normal, but a little more weathered than before. Stone items are affected very little, but wood rots, metal rusts or corrodes through, and other materials suffer similar results. The next time an object affected by this spell is picked up or otherwise used, it crumbles into ruin. If the object is already under strain when the spell is cast on it, it gives way immediately.
This spell allows a spellcaster to sabotage crucial objects or pieces of equipment: a ladder rung, a wooden step, the sword of an enemy, etc. A fleeing ninja can use this spell to drop a portcullis, booby trap a stairway he has just descended, or destroy a weapon about to be wielded against him. It will not allow the ninja to sink a boat; the keel exceeds the spell's volume limitations. (However, a hull patch that does not exceed the volume limitation could be destroyed by the spell.)
The spell does not affect living creatures. It will not cancel the effects of a potion of longevity. If cast on such a potion, however, the spell permanently renders the potion useless. A potion of longevity is the only item that does not receive a saving throw against this spell.
Notes: Restricted to ninja spellcasters and those trained by them; common.

Agitate Wounds — Old Empire
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous + Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the caster can affect a creature that has been wounded by an edged weapon. This spell reopens bound wounds (or causes unbound wounds to bleed severely), inflicting 2d6 points of damage. One who rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell suffers no further damage from this spell. If the saving throw fails, however, the victim suffers 1d3 additional points of damage per round until the wound is dressed and bound (or bound again, as in the case of reopened wounds). Creatures without blood, such as skeletons, are unaffected by this spell, as are those with regeneration abilities and those under the effects of a periapt of wound closure or similar magic.
The material component for this spell is a pinchof salt.
Notes: Uncommon for necromancers, otherwise rare. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Agra's Ambush
(Abjuration)
(Mentalism)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 turn + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg. (when cast) 1/2 (when triggered)
This spell is used against psionic opponents. When cast, it creates a mental trap in the subject's mind. An unwilling recipient of this spell is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to prevent Agra's ambush from being set in its mind.
This trap instantly discharges upon any psionic contact or attack, as well as mind-contacting spells such as ESP and telepathy. The trap causes 1d4 hit points damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster to the initiator of the contact, save vs. spell for half damage.
The material component is some roughly ground glass, which must be sprinkled in a circle around the recipient.
Notes: Uncommon or rare for mentalists and psionic spellcasters; otherwise very rare. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Aiming at the Target
(Invocation)
Level: 5
Components: S
Range: 0
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Duration: Maximum 2 turns
Saving Throw. None
This spell is an outgrowth of the wu jen's training in meditation and his ki powers. It is cast by calming and clearing the mind through carefully controlled and strict breathing exercises. This action releases the energy of the spell.
When cast, this allows the wu jen to concentrate ona single action regardless of other actions It is one of only two spells a wu jen can cast without breaking the concentration required to maintain another spell (finding the center also has this property). A wu jen could cast phantasmal force on one round and aiming at the target the next without breaking the concentration he needs to maintain the phantasmal force.
Once cast, it allows the wu jen to move normally, receive his normal defensive adjustment for Dexterity, suffer damage, and make successfal saving throws without breaking his concentration. The mind of the wu jen is focused on the spell he is concentrating on, yet he is aware of events occurring around him.
The duration of the spell is two turns or until he stops concentrating on the first spell.
Notes: Restricted to oriental spellcasters and those trained by them. Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Air Spiral
(Alteration, Evocation)
(Air)
Level: 8
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 8
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
An air spiral spell creates an upright, helixshaped, revolving staircase in the air It appears with one of its treads firmly under the caster's feet. The caster can choose to be at the top or bottom of the stair, or anywhere in between. The staircase itself can rise or descend at a flying movement rate of 9, aneuverability Class D, as the caster wills. It revolves in an area 90 feet high and 20 feet in diameter.
Although the air spiral cannot move through solid objects, it can pierce all known magical barriers (such as forcecages and prismatic spheres), opening permanent safe-passage holes in them as large as the stair-spiral. A being on the stair could safely pass a barrier, but one clinging to the outside of the stair rail would be subject to the effects of contact with the barrier. When an air spiral strikes an immobile solid object (such as the ground or a wall), it does so gently, in the same way a featherfall spell minimizes the shock of a landing.
All beings who can reach this staircase can stand onit, cling to it, or chmb up and down it. While in direct contact with the air spiral, beings can breathe underwater if the stair takes them there, and they are immune to the effects of heat, cold, electrical discharges (including all sorts of lightnmg), and all crushing or constricting attacks (including water pressure and spell or monster attacks).
In any round, the caster can work only one of these effects, and can affect only one creature.
* The caster of the air spiral, whether on the stair or not, can by will banish any extraplanar creature in contact with the stair instantly back to its home plane. Such creatures get no saving throw.
* The caster can also force any being touching the stair back into its true form, thus ending any curses, shapechange magics, illusions, and disguises of less than demigod power that mask the being's real appearance.
The caster can also make the magic end and the stair vanish at will, or cause it to explode in whirling eddies that occupy the same volume as the spiral, but have the following effects:
* They extinguish all flames instantly.
* They destroy any air elementals on contact, or they banish any other sorts of creatures from the Plane of Elemental Air back to that plane, and bind them so that they cannot reenter the Prime Material Plane for one lunar cycle (about a month) per level of the caster. (Such creatures can travel freely to and among all other planes if they normally have the ability to do so.)
* If they have not been used upon creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air, the eddies inflict 1d12 points of damage plus 1d4 hit points per level of the caster on any other single creature, and force a system shock survival roll upon all beings of 7 or less experience levels or Hit Dice. Failed system shock rolls result in death.
This spell is often collapsed instantly into its whirling eddies aspect by casters secking to use it only as an offensive weapon or to extinguish flames.
Notes: Rare for Air mages and very rare for others in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Airball
(Evocation)
(Air)
Level: 8
Range: 120 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creates one 10-ft. diam. sphere
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, a stormy-blue, bouldersized sphere of air under incredible pressure is created within 120 yards of the caster. If created in the air, the ball (which weighs about 5 Ibs.) immediately falls toward the ground. If it falls 20 feet or more, the ball breaks into eight separate blasts of wind upon striking the ground, each equal to a gust of wind spell cast by an 8th-level spellcaster (winds of 30 m.p.h.); each blowing in one of eight compass directions from the point of impact (N, NE, E, etc.). In addition, the winds stir up all local dust and dirt for 1d4 rounds, limiting vision to 10 feet in their areas of effect. If the airball lands on water, the spray blast has the same effect.
If the airball fails to burst, then it cannot be moved once it touches the ground, remaining stationary and permanent until broken. The sphere is AC 6; any damage will penetrate its sensitive surface and set it off, although touching or pushing on it won't do so.
The spell requires one million cubic feet of air: for example, a 100 x 100 x 100-foot volume. From this open air is drawn the compressed air for the sphere. Note, however, that casting this spell does not create a vacuum.
Notes: Rare; uncommon for Air mages. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Airboat
(Alteration, Enchantment)
(Air)
Level: 8
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: 1 cloud
Saving Throw: None
This spell must be cast under a cloudy sky. The caster points at a cloud, which immediately descends toward him. As it comes closer, the cloud changes shape, becoming any sort of vessel imagined by the wizard (a dragon-shaped galley, a one-man dinghy, etc.).
Although the airboat is made of cloud, it feels solid and can support the weight of the caster plus one passenger per level ofthe wizard. It can move at a rate of 21 (MC: D).
The caster maintains total telepathic control over the airboat's speed and direction. While controlling the vessel, the wizard is able to perform other actions but cannot cast other spells.
Notes: Common for Air mages; uncommon for others (ToM).

Airbolt
(Alteration)
(Air, Force, Water)
Level: 3
Range: 20 yds. (60 yds. underwater)
Components: V
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: None
Using only verbal components, this spell focuses the air around the caster into a powerful invisible bolt; a concentrated blast of air roughly 3 inches in diameter. Airbolt is particularly effective underwater.
Only one creature or object can be the target of this spell. Damage for this spell underwater is 1d6 per level, to a maximum of 10d6 at 10th level. A saving throw vs. spell is allowed for half damage. The spellcaster blows a puff of air as this spell is cast.
In the air, this bolt inflicts only half the number of dice damage as it does underwater (round up), and it will not not work in a vacuum at all.
Notes: Uncommon for Air and Water mages; rare for others. (Updated from Dr4Gon Magazine.)

Airsphere
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3 rds.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This creates a mobile sphere of breathable air, identical to the atmosphere of the caster's home world or land. This air can be fouled with use as other atmospheres, but drives out and displaces any fouled aur it contacts for the first three turns of its existence.
The air comes into being around the caster, but does not mix with the surrounding atmosphere. During the first three turns, the caster can mentally move the airsphere in any direction, at a movement rate of 9, to a distance of 10 yards per level. Thereafter it is no longer under the caster's control, and obeys the gravity of nearby objects This spell is often used to aid a stranded being in space by hurling air to him.
If an airsphere contacts a fiery explosion in the phlogiston, the fiery area expands to the limits of the airsphere and fouls it. Those within this expanded area of effect suffer +1 point per die of normal fire damage.
The material component (broken during casting) is a small crystal or glass sphere holding air.
Notes: Common for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise rare.

Airy Water
(Alteration)
(Air, Water)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius sphere or 15-ft. radius hemisphere
Saving Throw: None
The airy water spell turns normal liquid, such as water or water-based solutions, into a less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if the wizard wanted to enter an underwater place, he would step into the water, cast the spell, and sink downward in a globe of bubbling water. He and any companions in the spell's area of effect can move freely and breathe just as if the bubbling water were air. The globe is centered on and moves with the caster. Waterbreathing creatures avoid a sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, although intelligent ones can enter it if they are able to move by means other than swimming. No water-breathers can breathe in an area affected by this spell. There is only one word that needs to be spoken to actuate the magic; thus, it can be cast under water. The spell does not filter or remove solid particles of matter.
The material component of the spell is a small handful of alkaline or bromine salts.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Alacrity
(Alteration)
(Chronomancy)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
The use of an alacrity spell allows the wizard to speed up the casting of spells of Sth level and lower. Only spells that are cast within the alacrity spell's duration are affected.
Casting times of 2-5 are reduced by 1; casting times of 6-9 are reduced by 2; and a casting time of one round is reduced to a casting time of 8. Casting times for spells that require more than 1 round are reduced by 20% (e.g., an animate dead spell affected by alacrity could be cast in only 4 rounds). Spells that have a casting time of 1 are not affected by this spell.
The material component is a miniature hour glass, which is destroyed when the spell is cast.
Notes: Uncommon spell (ToM).

Alahandra's Questing Call
(Divination)
Level: 3
Range: 10-mile radius
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3 turns
Duration: 3 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 mirror
Saving Throw: Neg.
Created by Alahandra of Waterdeep, this spell calls forth the images of adventurers who are "between quests" at the moment. The spellcaster is not in control of what sort of adventurers the spell indicates, and the adventurers must be within range of the spell. The spell often misfires (30%), showing either nothing or scenes from another plane of existence entirely.
Only the vague shadowy image of one or two of the adventurers and their approximate location is indicated by the spell.
The materials needed area silver mirror, a small bell, and a candle made from beeswax. Only the mirror remains after the spell's completion.
Notes: Uncommon or rare for diviners; otherwise rare or very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Alamanther's Return
(Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 60 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: As duplicated spell
Area of Effect: As duplicated spell
Saving Throw: As duplicated spell
This spell allows the caster to duplicate the effects of any one wizard spell he has seen cast—even if he does not know how to cast the spell, lacks the necessary material components, and is ignorant of even the spell's name. The duplicated effect cannot be a magical item discharge, psionic effect, natural spell-like power, or a priest spell. The damage, extent, and duration of the duplicate spell match exactly those of a chosen casting that the caster saw. The target of the return is up to its caster, and need not duplicate that of the observed casting.
Should the caster try to exceed the original spellcaster's maximum range, the duplicated spell will go as far as the original spellcaster could have sent it, and its effects appear at that point. For example, a 5th-level wizard's fireball goes 60 yards, Suppose the caster saw it cast only 30 yards. If the caster duplicates the fireball and targets a creature 80 yards away, the fireball will go 60 yards toward the creature and detonate at the limit of the original wizard's range.
Alamanther's return cannot be used to duphicate any spell available to the caster. A spell scanned but never memorized by the caster or a spell the caster cast once froma scroll that then faded is not considered available for these purposes. Any spell the caster has researched, studied, or copied into a spellbook is considered available, even if it is not currently memorized and the book it is written in is inaccessible. The dweomer allows only one casting based on one sighting; after using A/amanther's return, the wizard must see another casting of an unavailable spell before Alamanther ' return can create that effect once more.
The spell is named for the mage who devised it, Alamanther of Aglarond. Alamanther was once the consort of the Simbul, before he was destroyed in a duel with a Red wizard of Thay. Alamanther delighted in using it to hurl nasty spells used on him right back at those who cast them.
Notes: Rare or very rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Alamir's Fundamental Breakdown
(Divination)
(Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Alchemy)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 object or compound
Saving Throw: Special
By casting this spell, the wizard learns what
ingredients and formulas were used to create a
chemical mixture or magical item. The information instantly appears in the caster's mind but may
be lost if the wizard cannot comprehend it. The
caster must roll an Intelligence check; if successful, the wizard understands the formula and retains
it in his memory. If the roll is failed, the caster cannot comprehend what he has learned and the information is immediately forgotten. If the spell is cast
a second time on the same substance, the spell
automatically fails unless the wizard has advanced
to the next experience level. The caster's level
determines the type of information gleaned:
+ 5th Level: The type and quantity of ingredients
and the preparation process required to produce a
nonmagical mixture are learned. For example, the
wizard could learn how to produce Greek fire or
gunpowder from a sample, or could learn the
recipe for something simple, like chocolate cake.
+ 9th Level: The wizard can learn the proper
ingredients and formula for making a magical
liquid (potion, scroll ink, etc.).
+ 14th Level: The caster can learn the formula for
creating any type of magical object, excluding
unique items and objects of extreme power
(artifacts and relics).
In all cases, simply knowing the proper formula does not mean the wizard can successfully
create the item or material. The construction of
alchemical mixtures and magical items is a timeconsuming and expensive undertaking.
This spell has detrimental effects on the magical item analyzed. Single-use items (potions, oils,
etc.) are automatically destroyed; the spell consumes the item in the process of analyzing it.
Reusable magical items must make a saving
throw vs. disintegration. If the saving throw is
failed, Alamir's fundamental breakdown releases
the magic of the item in an explosive blast, rendering it permanently nonmagical. The caster suffers 4d8 points of damage from the explosion.
The material component is a wand cut from a
100-year-old oak tree. The wand is used to touch
the item in question, and vanishes in a puff of
smoke when the spell is complete.
Notes: Uncommon or rare spell (JoM).

Alarm
(Abjuration, Evocation)
(Geometry)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 4 hrs. + 4 hr/level
Area of Effect: Up to 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: None
When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a
selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat—anything larger than
about 4 cubic foot in volume or more than about 3
pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any
creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password
established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a
loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-
foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each
interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one
round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying
or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or noncorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can
dismiss the alarm with a single word.
The material components of this spell are a
tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Algarth's Embattlement
(Alteration)
Level: 9
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This infamous spell is sometimes called the box
of spells. It is one of very few known magics that
allow a caster to unleash more than one spell in a
round. After the spell is cast, the wizard can cast
up to six additional spells (each one in the usual
fashion, requiring normal material components
and the like) and store them, unreleased, as part of
Algarth's embattlement. Stored spells are still
memorized and prevent the caster from memorizing other spells in their place. For each spell stored,
the caster loses 1d4 hit points that cannot be
regained until the stored spell is cast. (At that time,
the damage can be restored by healing or rest; the
hit points do not return automatically.)
Spells of any level that the wizard can cast can
be stored. They can be unleashed by silent act of
will at any time, at a maximum speed of two spells
perround. No other being can provide spells for the
embattlement to store. Note that the caster must be
conscious, and for certain spells must be able to see
atarget, but need not speak, move, or employ matetial components to enact stored spells.
The spells stored in an embattlement cannot be
released or ruined by any magic short of Mordenkainen's disjunction. They persist even
beyond the death of the caster, who may later rise
as an undead able to unleash them! If the caster
outlives the spell duration without casting all of
the spells, however, unused ones are lost.
The material components of Algarth s embattlement are four drops of water and a gem of not
less than 4,000 gp value.
Notes: Rare or very rare in the FORGOTTEN
REALMs setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Allisandro's Binding Curse
(Alteration, Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: Same plane
Components; V, S,M
Casting Time: 3 hrs.
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
In many ways, this spell is an improved version
of the permanency spell, adapted for the laying of
curses. It permits the caster to weave a normally
temporary spell upon an individual and make it
permanent. Casting the spell, or even desiring to
learn it, is an evil act.
There is no linear limit to the range of this
curse, but the victim must be on the same plane.
Sufficient magical warding may block the spell.
On the Demiplane of Dread, the spell cannot
affect someone outside the domain in which it
was cast. Casting such a vengeful spell is cause
for a RAVENLOFT powers check.
The spells that can be used in conjunction with
this are antimagic shell, babble, bestow curse,
claws of the umber hulk, confuse languages, contagion, emotion, enervation, enlarge, feign death,
Seign undead, fist of stone, insatiable thirst, irritation, levitate, lower resistance, Malec-Keth's
flame fist, neverending nightmare, Otto's irresistible dance, reduce, suggestion, Tasha s uncontrollable hideous laughter, and unlock.
The wizard must cast the associated spell during the casting of Allisandro s binding curse.
None of these spells actually harm the victim
because they are bound to him. For example,
Otto ' irresistible dance does not produce fatigue,
nor does it prevent the individual from sleeping
(although he will present an odd sight dancing in
his sleep). Malec-Keth s flame fist will not burn
the character's fist, but could harm him if he tries
to scratch an itch.
Removing this spell is most difficult. A limited
wish spell will dispel the effects for one day per
level of the caster. Only a full wish can eliminate
Allisandro's binding curse.
The material component is an item from the
victim's body (see The Casting).
This loathsome spell was created by Allisandro
Tselikov, a member of the proud Vistani, several
hundred years ago. When the members of his
tribe learned that he had been delving into the
dark secrets of necromancy and attempting to
harness dark powers, they cast him out. He wandered, alone and broken, eventually becoming the
first of Ravenloft's darklings (a monstrous race).
In his isolation, he returned to the research that
he had been forced to abandon. Eventually he
crafted this spell to exact revenge upon the Vistani for the wrong he felt they had done him.
The Casting: In order to cast this spell, the
wizard must have some portion of the subject's
body. This can range from a lock of hair or nail
clippings to a severed finger or limb. The spell is
long and involved, requiring three hours to cast. It
is highly symbolic and involves a great deal of
ritual and ceremony. The wizard must have at
least two assistants who aid him in the weaving of
this dark magic. Neither of them can be under
any form of compulsion (such as a threat or magical charm) and both must be fully aware of the
act that they are involved in. The assistants need
not be spellcasters themselves.
At the end of the casting period, the material
component is thrown into a brazier of hot coals
where it is utterly consumed ina flash of sickly
light and a boiling cloud of vile-smelling vapor.
At that instant, the caster devotes a portion of his
own life force to the spell, being drained of 1
point of Constitution, permanently.
Notes: Uncommon in the RAVENLOFT* setting,
very rare elsewhere. The spell can be researched
only on the Demiplane of Dread.

Alter Beast
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Allows the caster to modify a selected part ofa
living creature's physical form. This could be
changing paws into hands, giving a quadruped an
upright, bipedal stance, increasing brain capacity,
and so on. The process requires a laboratory and at
least a week's preparation time. The casting inflicts
much pain, so the subject must be strongly willing,
immobilized, or unconscious during the casting.
Each use of this spell requires the subthe events of the dream as an illusionist has over
his phantasms; however, the caster must take care
not to disrupt the natural flow of the dream, or else
the dreamer may sense the presence of an intruder.
If the caster makes only "logical" changes ina
dream, the dreamer gains no saving throw and
must simply experience the dream to its conclusion or to the end of the spell's duration. For
instance, if the image of the dreamer's mother
turns from singing a lullaby to chiding the
dreamer for cheating a business partner, the
dreamer senses no intrusion. On the other hand, if
the dreamer's mother suddenly transforms into a
troll and attacks the dreamer, the sudden shock
allows a saving throw vs. spell. Success indicates
that the dreamer becomes aware of the spellcaster's intrusion and can attempt to eject the
spellcaster from the dream. The spellcaster must
roll a saving throw vs. spell every round. As long
as he succeeds, he can remain in the dream; if he
fails, he awakes and cannot return to the dream
without casting another alter dream spell.
ject to make a system shock survival
roll, (using a base 80% + 1%/HDif a
Constitution score is not available).
Changes made by this spell will
affect the creature's genetic makeup
thereafter. The effects might be
passed on to offspring if the creature
mates with a similarly altered creature of its own original species. Only
a limited wish or full wish will
reverse the spell's effects. The material component is two strands of
heavy gold wire twisted together in a
double helix.
Notes: Rare spell.

Alter Dream
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 sleeping creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell acts as an enter dream
spell, but allows the caster to affect
the course of the dream, much as a
director affects the course of a play.
The caster has the same control over
7 34Alter Normal Winds c
In addition to acting as an enter dream spell,
alter dream allows the caster to implant a suggestion (as the 3rd-level wizard spell). Alter dream
also permits the caster to warp the dream so that
it attacks the dreamer, with the same effects as
the 4th-level illusion spell phantasmal killer.
However, any failed attempt to kill the dreamer
automatically alerts the subject to the caster's
presence and gives him a chance to turn the phantasmal killer back on the spellcaster. The spellcaster must immediately end the spell or else face
the phantasmal killer.
The material components of this spell are a bit
of melted glass and a one-ounce strip of
dreamwillow bark, which the caster must steep in
hot water and imbibe.
Notes: Common for Dream mages; otherwise
uncommon. (Updated from DriGon Magazine.)

Alter Instrument — Bard
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 instrument
Saving Throw: None
By using this spell, a bard can transform one
musical instrument into another of similar size
and equal value. Any hand-held instrument can
be altered into any other hand-held instrument.
However, in order to obtain a large instrument,
such as a base harp, organ, or any other instrument that is too large or heavy to be easily cartied, the bard must start with an equally large
instrument.
In any event, the value of the new instrument is
identical to the original. A golden recorder will
generate a silver plated lute, a child's drum will
generate a nonfunctional lyre, etc.
Bards use this spell to save both money and
equipment carried. It is a lot cheaper to buy a single instrument and alter it when another is needed
than to buy every instrument that might be
required. This also saves a lot of space in one's
backpack.
If the instrument the bard wishes to alter is
being carried or played by another character, a
successful attack roll against the opponent's
Armor Class must be made in order to touch the
instrument.
Notes: Restricted to bards; uncommon.

Alter Normal Winds
(Alteration)
(Province: Wind) oe
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. diameter/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to harness a nonmagical wind and change its force by one rank,
as shown on Table 79, "Weather Conditions," in
the DMG. For example, "becalmed" conditions
(those found on a still day) can become a light
breeze. A light breeze can be diminished to
becalmed conditions or increased to a favorable
wind.
The spell works equally well in an enclosed
area, such as a dungeon, where "wind conditions" are considered becalmed. Wizards of the
9th level or less can modify only natural winds
of storm force or less. They can increase a
storm-force wind to gale-force, but cannot
affect an existing gale-force wind. At 10th
level, a wizard can alter gale-force winds, and
at 15th level, he can reduce hurricane-force
winds. The change caused by this spell is immediate, with the area of effect centered on the
caster. He can alter the wind only once (which
means by one level only). As long as a wind is
shaped by this spell, subsequent alter wind
spells cannot affect the same area. Other magics
that change wind or weather can affect an
altered wind, however. When the alter wind
spell ends, the air returns to its original state.
Alter wind has no effect on creatures of elemental air. Nor does it affect creatures that use air
in their attacks. The wind cannot deflect an
enemy's breath weapon and send it back toward
the attacker, for example. However, alter wind
does enable the caster to move nonmagical fog,
dust, or poisonous gas out of his way, negating its
effects for 1d6 rounds.
The spell requires a small silver tube, through
which the caster blows to attract the wind's
attention.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise
rare.

Alter Reality
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
Level: 7
Range: Unlimited
Components; Special
Casting Time: Special
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
The alter reality spell is potent but difficult to
use well. It will fulfill literally, but only partially
or for a limited duration, a condition visualized
by the spellcaster. To effect the magic, the caster
must depict the alteration of reality to the desired
state through the casting of a phantasmal force
spell, as well as verbalizing the desired state,
before the spell goes into action.
The actuality of the past, present, or future
might be altered in some limited manner (but
possibly only for the wizard unless the spell is
most carefully constructed). The conjuration will
not substantially change major realities, nor will
it bring wealth or experience merely by asking.
The spell can, for example, restore some hit
points lost by the wizard (or all hit points for a
limited duration). It can reduce opponent hit
probabilities or damage, increase duration of
some magical effect, cause a creature to be favorably disposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of
7th level or less, and so on. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the caster. The alter reality
spell nearly always can be used in place of a limited wish spell, if the caster is able to structure it
properly.
Casting time is based on the time spent preparing the wording for the spell and enacting the
phantasmal force. Normally the casting time is
one round (most of it being taken up by deciding
what to show).
Casting this spell ages the caster one year per
100 years of regular life span.
Notes: Restricted to illusionists and conjurers;
uncommon.

Alter Self
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 3d4 rds. + 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard can alter his
appearance and form— including clothing and
equipment—to appear taller or shorter; thin, fat, or
in between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The caster's
body can undergo a limited physical alteration and
his size can be changed up to 50%, If the form
selected has wings, the wizard can actually fly, but
at only one-third the speed of a true creature of that
type, and with a loss of two maneuverability
classes (to a minimum of E). If the form has gills,
the caster can breathe under water as long as the
spell lasts. However, the caster does not gain any
multiple attack routines or additional damage
allowed to an assumed form.
The caster's attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, or defenses.
Once the new form is chosen, it remains for the
duration of the spell. The caster can change back
into his own form at will; this ends the spell
immediately. A caster who is slain automatically
returns to his normal form.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Alternate Reality*
(Alteration)
Wild)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, the caster creates a small variation in probabilities. This variation lasts only a
moment, but creates alternate results for one
recent event. When the spell is cast, any one event
attempted by the recipient during the previous
round is recalculated, essentially allowing (or
forcing) the creature to make new die rolls.
Only events that begin and end in asingle
round can be affected. Only one die roll can be
rerolled. If the creature touched is a willing recipient, the player can choose which roll (the original or the new roll) affects him, more than likely
picking the most successful. If the creature is
unwilling, he must redo the action. The second
result, whatever its outcome, cannot be changed.
Typical uses of this spell include allowing a
fighter to reroll an attack, forcing an opponent to
reroll a saving throw, or allowing a wizard to
reroll the damage caused by a fireball.
The material component is a
small, unmarked die.
Notes: Restricted to wild
mages; uncommon (ToM).

Alustriel's Banner
(Iusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: 10 ft./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 banner
Saving Throw. None
Alustriel's banner causes an
impressive fanfare to sound as a
banner appears in midair wherever the caster
desires within spell range. The banner is usually
placed high in the air, though it can be directed
to appear right against a wall or door. The banner
can be of any size and appearance desired, from
rigid and shieldlike to a long pennant, and can
look new or ancient. The caster can also decide
whether or not it glows, and can make it vanish
at will. If it glows, the light it sheds is equal in
maximum effect to a light spell, and, within
these parameters, of the hue and intensity desired
by the caster. The fanfare lasts only one round or
less and can even be absent if the caster desires.
The fanfare must be trumpet or horn music
that the caster has actually heard at some past
time. The banner's form and any device, coat-ofarms, or rune on it must be a decoration that the
caster has actually seen.
Sometimes this spell is used to frighten folk into
thinking they are encountering a watchful ghost or
guardian magic. For example, if thieves or wouldbe slayers are suddenly confronted with a royal
coat-of-arms on the door of the king's bed chamber that they are stealthily approaching, they may
think it is guarded by some powerful magic. The
spell is most popular, though, as abattlefield
recognition symbol, rallying device, or directional
marker, It is often cast high up in the air, by night,
to illuminate a skirmish or embattled camp.
Another of Alustriel's early spells, this magic
has gained favor among armies and mercenary
bands all over Faerfin because of its battlefield
usefulness.
The material component of an Alustriel's banner is either a real trumpet or horn or a tiny model
of one made of bone, ivory, whittled wood, or
metal
Not incommon or rare in the FORGOTTEN
REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Alustriel's Fang
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 weapon
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to fire a dagger,
dart, or other piercing weapon shorter than the
forearm, ina straight line from hand to target, at a
foe within 60 feet. The caster must be proficient
in the use of the weapon.
The weapon makes one attack each round, as if
wielded by a wizard two levels higher than the
caster, does +1 more than its normal damage per
hit, and then returns to the caster's hand, unless prevented from doing so, flying at rate of 12 (MC: A).
The enchanted weapon is a +1 magical weapon
for purposes of what it can hit, and it is not
harmed by the spell in any way. To prevent the
weapon's return, a target must have been struck
by the weapon, must have made a successful
Dexterity check to grasp the weapon, and must
have made a successful Strength check to retain
hold, breaking the spell. If either check fails, the
weapon slips free and returns to the caster
The weapon awaits the caster having a free
hand on its return, hanging motionless in midair
as near the caster as possible if the caster's hands
are both busy. In other words, it does not interrupt
climbing or spellcasting. If one of the caster's
hands does not become free, the weapon simply
falls to the ground when the spell expires.
The material components of this spell are the
weapon and a pinch of iron filings.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, and select Harpers; uncommon or
rare.

Alustriel's Improved Mantle
(Abjuration)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell protects the caster or a single willing
recipient touched during the casting by enveloping the chosen being in a close-fitting magical
defensive field. Alustriel's improved mantle is
normally invisible, but can be made by the desire
of the wearer to shimmer, glow faintly (in any hue
and changing in response to the wearer's will), or
shine brightly. When it shines brightly, it is never
blinding, but it is bright enough to read by or to
allow one to see 10 feet or so in all directions in
nonmagical darkness.
The mantle wards off all physical weapons of
+1 enchantment or less. It also prevents the functioning of all spells or equivalent magical item
effects of 4th level or less within its confines. A
caster protected by an Alustriel s improved mantle
could stand in the heart of a fireball that burst and
crisped beings standing all around her, and
escape with herself and all she wore and carried
completely unharmed. The wearer of such a mantle (which, despite its name, is a magical field,
not a garment) also receives a +2 bonus on all
saving throws.
If any Alustriel's improved mantle ever comes
into direct contact with another improved mantle, or with an Alustriel's mantle (the lesser spell
related to this one), the result is a brief writhing
chaos of swirling magic that wracks any protected beings involved with horrible pain, rendering them helpless for 1d2 rounds, and deals
them each 4d10 points of damage as the mantles
collapse.
The material components of an Alustriel's
improved mantle are a gem of any sort worth 50
gp or more anda tiny glass vial that the caster has
breathed into and then stoppered at least a day
(24 hours) before casting the spell.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, and select Harpers; rare or very rare.

Alustriel's Mantle
(Abjuration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time:
Duration: 6 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell protects the caster, or a single spell
recipient touched during the casting, by enveloping the chosen being in a close-fitting magical
defensive field. An Alustriel s mantle is normally
invisible, but can be made by the desire of the
wearer to shimmer, glow faintly (in any hue and
changing in response to the wearer's will), or
shine brightly. When it shines brightly, it is never
blinding, but it is bright enough to read by or to
allow one to see 10 feet or so in all directions in
dark subterranean surroundings.
The mantle wards off all physical weapons
except for those that bear a magical dweomer of
any sort. It prevents the functioning of all Ist- or
2nd-level spells or equivalent magical item
effects within its confines, A caster protected by
an Alustriel's mantle could stand in the path of a
flaming sphere that rolled over her, and it would
do her no damage while still having normal
effects on other beings in its range. She could
also walk through a hail of nonmagical arrows or
ignore nonmagical dagger attacks.
If two Alustriel's mantles ever come into contact, the result is a brief writhing chaos of swirling
magic that wracks any protected beings involved
with horrible pain, rendering them helpless for
1d2 rounds, and deals them each 4d8 points of
damage as the mantles collapse.
The material component of an Alustriel's mantle is a tiny glass vial that the caster has breathed
into and then stoppered at least a day (24 hours)
before spellcasting.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, and select Harpers; uncommon or rare.

Alustriel's Sword of Stars
(Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 blade
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a shimmering, translucent
construct of force. This construct is a cluster of
winking, pulsing lights that resemble stars in the
night sky, grouped in the shape of a two-handed
sword of the largest size. For purposes of determining what it can hit, this construct is considered a +2 magical weapon, though it does not
gain this attack or damage bonus.
This sword of stars forms on the round following the spell's casting and silently attacks a chosen target creature. It pursues, attacking twice per
round at a THAC0 of 9 (regardless of the caster's
own THAC0), and dealing 4d4 points of damage
at a successful strike, until the target being is
slain, the sword of stars is destroyed, or the spell
expires. The sword can follow a being anywhere
on the same plane, though long distance teleports
cause the magic to expire before the pursuing
sword reaches its target.
A sword of stars flies at a movement rate of 21
(MC: A), It has an AC of —2 and has 22 hit points.
It vanishes if destroyed by physical attacks. Magical attacks of any sort have no effect on it at all,
save that dispel magic or a properly worded limited wish or wish spell can make it vanish. The
magical blade fights by itself, not requiring the
caster's attention once created.
The material component of this spell is any
metal-bladed weapon. The weapon is consumed
in the casting, so cheap daggers or tiny replicas
are most often used.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, and select Harpers; rare or very rare.

Alvira's Stasis Shell
(Alteration)
(Dimension)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
The largest object that can be affected by this
spell is a large standard spellbook, and the smallest
object is the size of a potion vial. An object protected by this spell cannot be affected by any force
less powerful than a disintegrate spell, though the
stasis shell itself can be dispelled. Water, fire, acid,
lightning, and even dragon breath merely move
along the outer shell of the stasis field.
The protected object is surrounded by a faint
blue glow. The object has its normal weight and
can be moved normally, though it cannot be physically touched or accessed; for example, a protected book could not be opened. The spell
cannot affect living tissue directly, though reports
exist that living tissue in a container can be
warded. For all intents, time has stopped for the
object in the field.
‘Alvira of the Living City created this spell to
use in conjunction with permanency. She then
cast it upon a copy of her spellbook and hid it
where it would remain for years, just in case
something happened to her original spellbook.
Notes: Rare or very rare. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Alyssindra's Summons
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level. 9
Components: V, S,M
Range: 100 mi.
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
Alyssindra's summons resembles the 9th-level
wizard spell succor in that it can summon another
being to the caster's presence. Unlike succor,
however, this spell brings an unwilling creature
from up to 100 miles away. The caster must have
an item the summoned creature has touched
within the last week. The caster also must know
the creature's name and have a detailed idea of
what that individual looks like.
A summoned creature failing a saving throw
vs. spell finds itself and the equipment it is carrying transported into the caster's presence. The
spell is not exact enough for casters to control
precisely where the summoned creature appears.
For example, a wizard standing near a fire pit
cannot summon the being into the pit—unless the
caster was in there too, and the pit was larger than
20 feet across. Likewise, casters can't call targets
into shackles or restraints.
If the desired target of this spell does not
appear (out of range, invalid material component,
successful saving throw, etc.), the wizard has a
50% chance to accidentally summon a random
creature from another plane instead. This creature
is likely to be immediately hostile to the caster. If
the summoned target has simply made a successful saving throw, this risk is only 1%.
Notes: Rare or very rare spell.

Ambush — Hishna
(Alteration, [lusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 3 individuals/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows the caster and other individuals (up to 30 at 10th level) to conceal themselves
in any kind of outdoor terrain. The concealed
characters must remain reasonably still and silent,
or the spell will be broken, but as long as they do
so they will blend in with the landscape—be it
trees, short grass, even a flat expanse of sand.
Ifa party approaches the ambush, the leading
character in that party is entitled to a saving
throw vs. spell. If successful, this negates the
magic and the leading character has the normal
chance to discover the ambushing party. Failure
means the ambushers will surprise the party
unless other factors intervene.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of hishna
magic (the Maztica setting).

Amorphous Blob
(Alteration, Necromancy)
(Alchemy)
Level: 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 glass orb
Saving Throw: None
The caster uses this spell to activate a dangerous
amoeboid lifeform inside a glass orb. The orb is
filled with a specially-prepared fluid. Casting the
spell allows the fluid inside the sphere to congeal
into the lifeform, which is released when the glass
is shattered. The wizard can smash the ball by hurling it at an opponent (treat as a grenade-like missile), but great care must be taken since the caster
has no control over his creation once it is released.
The monster feeds in order to grow, and it grows
extremely fast. The blob expands to a volume of
four cubic feet upon its release, but on a killing
attack, it engulfs its prey and gains 1 hit point for
each Hit Die of the dead victim. Every 8 hit points
gained by the blob endows it with an additional Hit
Die (in terms of fighting ability) and results in not
only an increase in volume of 4 cubic feet, but also
a cumulative bonus of +1 on damage rolls. Modified damage rolls cannot exceed 12 hit points per
round. For example: A blob kills 4 opponents with
2 hit points each. It grows 4 cubic feet larger and
attacks as a 4 HD monster, doing 3d4+1 points of
damage per round.
The blob needs only one round to grow. During
this time the creature can perform no other
action. Increases in Hit Dice, size, and damage
are permanent and do not decrease with the loss
of hit points. No known limit exists to the blob's
total volume, and if not soon killed, the creature
can become extremely powerful.
The blob can regenerate 1 hit point per round,
but this ability cannot bring a dead blob back to
life. The creature can flow through narrow openings and can ooze along walls and ceilings. The
blob also secretes a digestive acid that dissolves
wood (at a rate of 2 inches per round) and metal (at
arate of 4 inch per round); stone and glass remain
unaffected. Cold does no damage to the blob, but
slows the monster (as the spell) for 2-8 rounds.
Fire harms the creature normally, but lightning
imbues the blob with an extra hit point for every
Hit Die of damage; thus, a 6d6 lightning bolt
causes no damage but endows the creature with 6
hit points, possibly increasing its size and attack
potential. Mind-influencing spells, of course, have
no effect upon this unintelligent creation, and all
forms of magical control are useless against it.
Preparation: Preparing for the casting of this
spell requires that the wizard first construct a
crystal orb filled with a swirling, gelatinous fluid.
The orb and its contents take 1 to 4 weeks to
manufacture. In order for the orb to be made
properly, the wizard must enlist the aid of an
experienced alchemist and must build a special
laboratory equipped with its own strange, custom-made apparatus, the total cost of which is no
Jess than 5,000 gp.
The wizard also needs to procure the following
ingredients used to formulate the weird fluid: one
pint of the spellcaster's blood, three pints of ochre
jelly, and one dram of acid from a black pudding.
With these ingredients, the wizard prepares a viscous solution and encapsulates it in a finely
blown glass ball, 1 foot in diameter. The wizard
then holds the sphere, casting shocking grasp to
prime the liquid contents.
Once these procedures are completed, the wizard can use the orb at any time thereafter to cast
an amorphous blob spell. Should the glass container break before the spell is actually employed,
the fluid is lost and the wizard must start the
process over again from scratch.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in The Cryptichronos, aka The Book of Horrors. (Updated
from DRAGON Magazine.)

Amplify
(Alteration)
(Song)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 source of sound
Saving Throw: None
This spell changes the volume of sounds created close to its center of effect. The caster moves
his hand in a circular motion at the point he wants
to center the spell. With the uttering of a command word, the area outlined begins to glow
softly. The outlined area is disk-shaped and can
be as small as 2 inches in diameter or as large as
1 foot in diameter.
The disk acts as a sound magnifier: Whatever
sound enters the active (caster) side of the disk
can exit the other side at a much different volume. The volume can be increased or decreased
at the caster's mental command: up to five times
louder, or softer, than normal. It has no effect on
special sound-based attacks (in much the same
way that an enlarge spell does not change the
effect of a potion).
The material component is a small cone of
paper.
Notes: Rare. Known to be in the Darsson''s
Notes.

Analyze Device
(Divination)
(Artifice)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 clockwork device
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a mechanician to discern the
workings of a clockwork device created by
another such wizard. The spell is not exact, however, and reveals details about the mechanical
construct randomly. This can make it difficult to
determine the primary purpose of the construct.
For every round that the spell lasts, the mechanician will be able to determine one random function
of the target mechanical. The spell doesn't reveal
the strength of a particular function, just that it
exists. As far as the spell is concerned, there is no
difference between a construct that attacks with a
dagger and one that uses a great scimitar. To the
spell, these are both attack functions, and it doesn't
distinguish between them. If there is an implanted
spell in the construct, this spell will reveal it, but
not which spell it is
The analyze device spell doesn't reveal the
number of functions that a mechanical construct
has. Once it has revealed all the functions ofa
particular construct, the spell simply ceases to
function, duration notwithstanding.
The spell can also be used to determine the
basic hit points, Armor Class, and THAC0 of a
given mechanical construct, though each of these
is considered a separate function.
In order to use this spell, the mechanician must
study the target device for a round or so, and the
construct must be stationary. Thus, it is impossible to use this spell on a mechanical construct
that is currently attempting hostile action.
If cast by a mechanician, this spell must be
implanted into a mechanical device (the focus of
this spell), usually a simple piece of headgear or a
set of lenses. Wearing or touching the analyze
device mechanical and concentrating on the
object to be analyzed activates the spell.
Other wizards can learn this spell, in which
case no device is needed. When cast by a member
of a kit other than a clockwork mage, the spell is
less efficient, revealing one function of the
device every two rounds.
Notes: Common in arabian settings for clockwork mages; uncommon for diviners, artificers,
and mechanicians; otherwise very rare.

Analyze Dweomer
(Divination)
(Artifice)
Level: 8
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 8 hrs.
Duration: 1 rd./2 levels
Area of Effect: 1 object or creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell reveals to the caster all spells,
enchantments, dweomers, and magical properties
present in one creature or object. One property,
spell, or power is revealed each round in approximate order of when the spells were cast or the
properties were acquired. (If the DM doesn't
know which spells were placed on the subject
first, a random roll for order of discovery is fine.)
The caster has a base 50% chance to discern the
existence and identity of a particular spell or
property, +2% per level to a maximum of 99%,
The only enchantments that remain inscrutable to
analyze dweomer are those surrounding artifacts
or relics.
Example: A 16th-level wizard finds an
unknown wand and decides to use analyze
dweomer to study it. The DM knows that it's a
wand of fire, and he decides that the spells
enchant an item, fireball, burning hands, and
wall of fire were used to create the wand, in that
order. In the first round, the wizard has an 82%
chance to identify enchant an item; in the following round, an 82% chance to discover fireball; in
the next round, an 82% chance to perceive burning hands; and so on, for all remaining enchantments. Note that the DM could have decided that
any rare or unusual materials or processes used to
create the wand would also be revealed as if they
were spells.
After the wizard analyzes one object or creature, the spell ends, even if its duration has not
expired yet. Casting this spell is physically taxing; the wizard must pass a system shock check
or be exhausted and unable to do anything but
rest for the next 1d8 hours. While this spell is
most frequently used in the comfort and safety of
the wizard's laboratory, a wizard could also cast
analyze dweomer to study the magical seals and
barriers on a portal, to determine just how a companion has been cursed, or to examine a potential
opponent for defensive spells.
The material component for this spell is a tiny
lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop.
The gemstone must be worth at least 1,000 gp.
Notes: Common for diviners and artificers;
otherwise uncommon (PO:SM).

Andrui's Baneful Backfire
(Abjuration)
Level: 5
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Until triggered
Area of Effect: 1 enchanted object
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables a wizard to protect his magical property and enchantments from tampering
by other spellcasters. The backfire can be cast on
any magical item or object even temporarily
endowed with magical properties (such as a character who has been slowed).
The backfire remains dormant until such time
as a character attempts to cast dispel magic on the
object. The backfire not only causes the dispel to
fail automatically, but the dispelling caster loses
one memorized spell of a level equal to the spell
or effect he was trying to dispel. If he has no such
spell, the backfire causes him to lose a spell of
the next lower level, until the caster has lost one
spell or has no spell to lose.
For example, suppose that a 7th-level wizard is
attempting to cast dispel magic on a door that has
been wizard locked and is protected by the baneful backfire. Upon casting the dispel, the wizard
instantly loses one 2nd-level spell (equal to the
level of the wizard lock) and the door is still magically sealed.
The baneful backfire is not effective against a
spellcaster of a higher level than the wizard who
cast it. In such a case, a successful dispel magic
would dispel both the ward and the spell it was
put in place to protect.
The physical component of the spell is a bit of
cat fur and a piece of carpeting roughly three
inches square.
Notes: Uncommon or rare spell.

Anesthesia
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
By meansof this spell, the caster renders the
subject unconscious and insensate for a period of
time. Only living creatures are subject to the
spell's effects—undead, golems, etc., are unaffected. While the anesthesia spell is in effect, the
subject has a +10% bonus to system shock rolls,
suffers only half damage from physical effects,
and receives the benefits of a slow poison spell.
The recipient is also completely helpless and can
be slain easily by a well-directed blow.
The base duration of the spell is two rounds per
level of the caster. The subject always rolls a saving throw vs. spell. If the subject was willing,
success reduces the duration by half; if unwilling,
the spell ends. When the spell ends, the recipient
has a penalty of 2 to attacks, saving throws, and
proficiency rolls: if willing, for 1 round per caster
level; if unwilling, for 1d8 rounds.
The material component is a lotus flower.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in the
Cyclopedia Phantastica, Vol. III. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Animal Companion
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Range: 1 mi. radius
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is only effective outdoors. When cast
by the wu jen, it summons one normal woodland
creature that is within a mile of the caster. The
creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. The
DM determines the type of creature summoned,
depending on terrain and level of the caster. The
creature's Hit Dice must be equal to or less than
half the level of the caster. This beast is friendly
toward the wu jen. It remains with him so long as
he travels through the wilderness, but will not go
more than 20 miles from its home. Upon entering
any large encampment, village, or other settlement, the beast parts company with the wu jen. In
addition, mistreating the beast causes it to leave
or even turn on the caster.
The spell does not provide telepathic or perfect
communication with the beast, but the animal
does understand the general meaning of spoken
commands and gestures. The animal is still a wild
beast and can be dangerous, especially if it misinterprets common situations as threatening. If well
treated, the animal defends and serves the wu jen
to the best of its ability and nature. Thus, a monkey would prefer harassment and tricks to outright combat, while a tiger would fearlessly
spring into the midst of the wu jen's enemies.
Common animals summoned include monkeys,
hawks, badgers, boars, bears, tigers, and serpents.
The spell requires a piece of candy, sugar, or
other tasty morsel for the creature summoned.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; rare elsewhere.

Animal Growth
(Alteration)
Reversible
Level: 5
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard causes all
designated animals, up to a maximum of eight,
within a 20-ft.-square area to grow to twice their
normal size. The effects of this growth are doubled Hit Dice (with improvement in attack rolls)
and doubled damage in combat. The spell lasts
for one round for each level of experience of the
wizard casting the spell. Only natural animals,
including giant forms, can be affected by this
spell.
The reverse, shrink animal, reduces animal
size by half and likewise reduces Hit Dice, attack
damage, etc.
The component of both versions of the spell is
apinch of powdered bone.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Animal Magnetism
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 hrs.
Duration: 1 breeding season
Area of Effect: 2 creatures
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is often used by wizards carrying out
breeding projects. Success raises the chance of a
successful mating by 5% per level of the wizard, to
amaximum of 95%, assuming the subjects are not
sterile. This spell does not guarantee a viable offspring, merely a successful mating. It can be cast
once per pair per mating season. It fails if used on
creatures that do not have a specific mating season.
The material component is a hair, scale,
feather, or similar item from each creature.
Notes: Very rare spell. (Updated from J@4GINE
Magazine.)

Animal Nonaggression — Bard
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Range: 30 yds.
Components: Special
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 5 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
Upon hearing this song's soothing tones, any
normal animals in its area of effect will cease to
act aggressively toward the bard's party. The song
is negated if the party molests the animals or their
lairs in any way. This song does not cause friendship on the animals' part, and it endows the bard
with neither communicative nor controlling ability. It has no effect on magical animals or on normal animals under magical control.
The bard must both sing and play an instrument to achieve this effect.
Notes: Restricted to bards; uncommon.

Animal Sanctuary
(Abjuration)
Level: 1
Range' Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: None
Attack rolls and damage against an animal protected by this spell suffer a 4 penalty. This spell
is frequently used on mounts, pets, and familiars,
If the animal attacks, the protection is broken.
The material component is a feather, bit of fur,
or a scale from the animal to be protected.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Animate Blood
(Necromancy) Q :
Level: 6
Range. 30 yds. + 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3 rds.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1d6 drops of blood
Saving Throw: None
This necromantic spell is used to create small,
animated beings from the blood of the caster.
These creatures are linked to the caster such that
he can utilize their senses as well as his own.
When the spell is cast, the wizard must cut
himself, spilling a few drops of blood. These
droplets take on the shape of small animals,
which move about at the bidding of the caster.
Despite their small size, these creatures can move
rapidly, covering 60 feet in a single round. They
are small enough to move under all but the most
secure doors, and they can ooze through any
crack that is not watertight (though this reduces
movement for that round by half).
The caster sees and hears as if he were where
the drops of blood are located. He can shift his
perception from one drop to the next at will. This
connection is maintained throughout the range of
the spell—if any ofthe blood drops pass beyond
this area, they will become ordinary drops of
blood and the spell ends.
This spell is often used to spy upon individuals
or to see what is beyond a door. This works fine
as long as the target is not a prepared wizard. If a
detect magic spell is cast on an area containing
any of the animated blood, the drops will flare
brightly and become instantly noticeable to anyone nearby. If a spell is cast upon the drop of
blood, it will also affect the caster
Evil wizards can also use these drops of blood as
an attack form. The blood can be commanded to
leap at a target up to 20 feet distant, striking as a
Sth-level fighter. Ifthe attack roll succeeds by four,
the drop of blood has landed in the target's eye, ear,
or mouth. Otherwise the drop has harmlessly struck
armor, or missed entirely, and becomes inert.
If the drop strikes and manages to hit an eye or
ear of the target, it does devastating damage. Every
round for four rounds, the drop of blood burns like
acid, causing 1d6 points of damage to the target.
Quenching the burning area with holy water halts
any further damage. This also affects the wizard,
whose own blood sizzles with sympathetic magic,
causing one point of damage each round. It should
be noted that using one's own blood in this manner
is an evil act, and DMs should consider the alignment implications carefully.
Notes: Uncommon in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Animate Dead
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 5 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates the lowest of the undead
monsters—skeletons or zombies—usually from
the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes existing
remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in
an area and attack any creature (or just a spe
cific type of creature) entering the place, ete.
The undead remain animated until they are
destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic
cannot be dispelled. The following types of dead
creatures can be animated:
A) Humans, demihumans, and humanoids with
J Hit Die. The wizard can animate one skeleton
for each experience level he has attained, or one
zombie for every two levels. The experience levels, if any, of the slain are ignored; the body ofa
newly dead 9th-level fighter is animated asa
zombie with 2 Hit Dice, without special class or
racial abilities.
B) Creatures with more than I Hit Die. The
number of undead animated is determined by the
monster Hit Dice (the total Hit Dice cannot
exceed the wizard's level). Skeletal forms have
the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have one more Hit Die. Thus, a 12thlevel wizard could animate four zombie gnolls (4
x [2+1 Hit Dice] = 12), or a single fire giant
skeleton. Such undead have none of the special
abilities they had in life.
C) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The
caster can animate two skeletons per level or one
zombie per level. The creatures have their normal
Hit Dice as skeletons and an additional Hit Die as 1
zombies. Clerics receive a +1 bonus when trying
to turn these.
This spell assumes that the bodies or bones are
available and are reasonably intact (those of skeletons or zombies destroyed in combat won't be!).
It requires a drop of blood and a pinch of bone
powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. The
casting of this spell is not a good act, and only
evil wizards use it frequently.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Animate Dead Animals
(Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 1
7 46 \r
\ imate Dead Monster ge
This spell creates undead skeletons and zombies
from the bones and bodies of dead animals, specifically vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds,
and mammals). The animated remains obey simple
yerbal commands given by the caster, regardless of
the language employed. Only naturally occurring
animals of no higher than semi-intelligence can be
animated with this particular spell (lizards, cats,
frogs, weasels, tigers, and so on), including minimals and nonmagical, giant-sized animals. These
undead animals remain animated until they are
destroyed in combat or turned; the animating
magic cannot be dispelled. The number of undead
that a wizard can animate depends on the animal's
original Hit Dice, the caster's level, and the type of
undead being created. The caster can create the
number of animal skeletons or zombies shown on
the table. The minimum caster level limits the Hit
Dice of animals that can be animated. For example, a Ist-level necromancer cannot animate a dead
war dog (2+2 Hit Dice).
Caster Animal No. of

Animated skeletons of animals that had ¥ to 1
HD conform to the statistics of animal skeletons
(see "Skeleton" in the MonsTRous MANUAL Tome).
Skeletons of animals that had less than 4 HD
when living conform to those same statistics,
with the following changes: AC 9, HD \%, hp 1,
#AT 1, Dmg 1.
Skeletons of animals of over 1 HD conform to
the regular animal statistics, with the following
changes: Armor Class is worsened by 2 (AC 10
maximum), damage per attack is reduced by 2
(cach hit inflicts a minimum of 1 point of damage), and movement is reduced by half (skeletal
bats and birds can fly).
Animal zombies conform to the statistics for
the particular animal that has been animated,
with the following changes: the animal's number
of Hit Dice is increased by one, AC is worsened
by 3 (AC 8 maximum), and movement is reduced
by half.
Skeletal and zombie animals gain the standard
undead immunities (resistance to cold-based,
sleep, charm, and hold spells), but lose any normal defenses that the living animal might have
had, They also lose any special attacks (rear claw
rake, swallowing whole, and so on) and cannot
inject poison or emit fluids, such as musk or
saliva. A swallowing special attack does no further damage to the creature swallowed, except to
trap it within the undead animal's rib cage. Priests
gain a +1 bonus when turning these undead.
This spell is often a necromancer's first experience animating corpses. For this to work, the animal bodies or skeletons must be intact. The
material components are a blood drop and bone
chip from the same species as the target remains
(only animals belonging to the same species can
be animated per spell).
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Animate Dead Monster
(Necromancy)
Casting Time: 5 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature/4 levels
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to animate one
humanoid or semi-humanoid skeleton or corpse
for every four experience levels of the caster.
Such creatures are the the animated remains of
bipedal monsters of more than 3 Hit Dice and
with endoskeletons similar to those of humans
except in size, which must be 7 feet or greater in
height. Typical subjects are ettins, ogres, trolls,
giants, carnivorous apes, and the like.
The dweomer empowers the caster to give any
umber of direct commands or instructions that
will be obeyed, up to 12 words long, much like
the animate dead spell.
Askeletal form will have Hit Dice equal to the
basic monster Hit Dice. A zombie form will have
one additional Hit Die. Animated monsters
receive their normal physical attacks, but have no
special attributes other than those possessed by
skeletons or zombies.
A monster zombie is turned as an undead with
the base creature's Hit Dice, while a skeletal
monster is turned as the next weaker type of
undead. For example, a zombie ogre would be
tumed as a shadow, while a skeletal ogre would
beturned as a ghoul.
The material component is a sliver of bone or a
gobbet of flesh from the body to be animated.
Notes: Common for necromancers; otherwise
rare.

Animate Dread Warrior — Red Wizard
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell, also known as animate dread warrior of Tam, creates an undead creature known as
adread warrior. It requires the corpse of a fighter
of at least 4th level who has been dead for less
than one full day (any longer and loss of intelligence renders the warrior unusable). After the
casting, the corpse rises as a dread warrior under
the control of the spellcaster.
A raise dead spell destroys one utterly. A resurrection spell requires the warrior to save vs.
spell. Failure destroys it outright; success restores
the warrior to life. This spell was developed by
Szass Tam of Thay for an invasion of Rashemen.
Notes: Common for Red Wizards of Thay;
uncommon for necromancers; rare for others.

Animate Fire
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Fire)
Level: 3
Range: 10 yds/level
Casting Time: 1rd.
Components: V, 8, M
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 cu. ft/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wu jen to control the
movements of normal fire. He can cause flames
to leap at an opponent, spread in a particular
direction, flare up into the sky, or fall to a quiet
smolder. The animated fire can be made to move
in any direction the caster wishes (at the rate of
3), provided there is combustible material for the
fire to feed upon. The wu jen can also cause the
fire to burn with greater heat, causing twice the
normal amount of damage. This consumes the
fuel of the fire at twice the normal rate.
The amount of fire a wu jen can animate is
determined by his level. This also determines the
range he can cause flames to reach from the main
fire source: a 9th-level wu jen can cause a flame
to reach out 9 feet from the main body of the fire.
Controlling the fire requires the wu jen to concentrate on the spell. If the concentration is broken before the end of the spell's duration, the
spell disappears.
The material components for this spell are a
handful of charcoal, sulphur, and soda ash.
Notes: Common in oriental settings;
mon for Fire mages; rare for others.

Animate Skeletons
(Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 30 ft. + 10 ft/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 skeleton/2 levels
Saving Throw: None
This specialized version of the animate dead
spell produces one skeleton for each level of the
caster. The animated skeletons obey the simple
verbal commands of the caster, and remain animated until destroyed in combat or turned by a
priest; the magic cannot be dispelled.
Only the skeletons of humans, demihumans,
and bipedal humanoid monsters of 1 Hit Die or
49 XKAnimate Water
less can be animated by means of this spell. The
experience levels of the slain are ignored; the
newly animated skeletons are treated as normal
skeletons (see the MONSTROUS MANUAL Tome).
The material component for this spell is a drop
of blood and a pinch of bone powder or a shard of
bone, plus a special salve, which costs at least 10
gp per dose to produce. The wizard must rub the
bones to be affected with the salve. One dose can
animate a single skeleton, and requires one round
to apply. The wizard can wait up to 24 hours
before finishing the animating spell with a single
word. The nearest treated skeletons within both
the range and the caster's level limit will animate.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.
(Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Animate Water
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Water)
Level: 2
Range: 20 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 5 ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wu jen to animate any
amount of water up to the area of effect. The wu
jen cannot shape the water, but can bid it to flow
in any direction he desires. So long as the wu jen
continues to concentrate on the spell, he can
cause the water to move about at the rate of 6.
However, the water is still subject to the natural
laws of evaporation, absorption, and gravity.
Thus, fire and heat quickly do away with the
water form, while earth turns to mud, drawing off
most of the watery body.
The wu jen can cause the animated water to
climb gentle grades, but walls, staircases, and
other abrupt rises are impassable to it. If used for
attack, the water does 1-2 points of damage per
5—foot cube of water animated, crashing in a
wave against opponents. While concentrating on
the spell, the wu yen can move at a rate of 3, but
no other actions can be taken. If the wu jen's concentration is broken before the end of the spell
duration, the spell is cancelled.
The material component for this spell is a
small vial of pure spring water mixed with
cinnabar.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise
very rare.

Animate Wood
(Alteration)
(Wood)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By meansof this spell, the wu jen is able to
cause wooden items to move and bend. It has its
greatest effect when cast upon living plants,
although it can be used on all types of wooden
items. When cast, the spell gives the wood suppleness and motion, possibly allowing the item to
move, grasp, entangle, etc. However, this movement is slow and somewhat stiff and thus animated objects always strike last in combat
situations. 1
The spell does not change the form of the item,
An arrow is still a single shaft, although it can
wriggle and move like a snake. Likewise, the
spell does not give fixed items the ability to move
about. Thus, a tree cannot be animated to walk
since it is rooted in one spot. However, animated
items can be ordered to attack as a 0 level human,
and cause damage comparable to a weapon of the
same size and type. An arrow could strike like a
snake causing damage as an arrow, while a tree
branch can club and thrash, causing damage as a
club. The DM must determine the exact range of
damage possible for the animated item.
The item has an Armor Class from 10 to 5,
based on the size, solidity, and maneuverability
of the object. An animated stand of bamboo
would have an Armor Class of 10 because it does 1
not move and is easily cut. A cypress tree could 1
easily have an Armor Class of 5 because it is
quite large and difficult to damage. Furthermore,
the item possesses hit points (0 hit points indicates the item has been chopped into pieces). Asa
guideline, each object possesses 1d10 hit points
for every 10 feet of height or square yard of area.
A spear shaft has 1d10 points while an arrow has
1 or 2 at most. A tall tree has 100 to 200 hit points
if it is quite massive.
The amount of material that can be animated
depends on if it is living or not. A single plant of
living wood (5 feet tall or less) can be animated
for every level of the caster. For nonliving wood,
a piece roughly the size of two arrows can be animated for every level of the caster. If the material
is magical (an arrow +1), a saving throw vs. spell
yp 50 \asa 20th-level wizard is allowed (6 or better),
further adjusted for any magical plus (the arrow
would save on a 5 or better). If successful, the
animation attempt has been resisted.
The material component for this spell is a mixture of powdered cinnabar and ground peach pit.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise
very rare.

Animate Zombies
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 10 yds. + 5 yds./2 levels
Components: V; S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 zombie/2 levels, 10 ft./level
Saving Throw: None
This variation of the animate dead spell produces one properly prepared zombie for each
experience level of the necromancer. Only the
bodies of humans, demihumans, and humanoids
of1 Hit Die or less can be animated by this spell.
The experience levels of the slain are 1gnored—
the newly animated zombies are treated exactly
as the zombies described in the MonsTROUS
Manuat Tome. They obey the verbal commands
of the necromancer, and remain animated until
destroyed in combat or turned by a priest. The
magic cannot be dispelled.
Preparation The necromancer must immerse
the corpses in a bath of special salts for at least
one full turn. The bath costs at least 200 gp to
prepare, and can accommodate up to ten mansized corpses, one at a time, before it is exhausted.
The necromancer can create a bath large enough
to soak two corpses at once for 400 gp, three for
600 gp, and so on. Once the corpses have been
properly treated, the necromancer can animate
them at any time within the next 24 hours.
The material component for this spell is a drop
of blood and a pinch of bone powder or a shard of
bone.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.
(Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Anticipation
(Divination)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This powerful spell allows the caster to correctly know what attacks and other actions all
beings within 60 feet at the time of casting will
attempt on the following round, so the caster can
act accordingly. For each weapon attack to occur,
the information gained is the type of weapon to
be used, whether the weapon is magical (but not
what magical power will be used), and the
attacker's intended target.
If the attack is to be a spell, the intended target
or area of effect of the spell is revealed, but not
the type of spell. For activities involving items,
the precise item to be used is learned. Often this
reveals the presence of hidden items to the caster.
Undead beings and creatures from other planes
cannot be "read" by this spell. Note that the spell
reveals the presence (but not location) of invisible
or disguised beings by communicating their
intended activities to the caster.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, selected Harpers, and diviners; rare.

Antimagic Aura — Elf
(Abjuration)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 individual
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell acts in somewhat the same manner
as the antimagic shell, but is intended for use
against an enemy spellcaster or enchanted creature. When cast, the spell creates a glittering aura
of light around the target, conforming exactly to
the target's body.
The subject of this spell can cast no magic, nor
can an affected enchanted creature attack or use
spell-like abilities for the spell's duration.
Enchanted weapons cannot use bonuses or special powers, functioning as ordinary weapons. As
with the antimagic shell, this spell is ineffective
against extra-planar creatures on their home
plane. Unlike antimagic shell, the aura can be
eliminated by a successful dispel magic spell
from an unaffected caster.
Notes: Common for elves of Evermeet;
uncommon for other elves; very rare for others.

Antimagic Shell
(Abjuration)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 ft-/level diameter
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard surrounds
himself with an invisible barrier that moves with
him. The space within this barrier is totally impervious to all magic and magical spell effects, thus
preventing the passage of spells or their effects.
Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical items or spells within its confines. The area is
also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or voice
attacks, and similar special attack forms.
The antimagic shell also hedges out charmed,
summoned, or conjured creatures. It cannot, however, be forced against any creature that it would
keep at bay; any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal
creatures (a normally encountered troll rather
than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the
area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while
a magical sword does not function magically
within the area, it is still a sword.
Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane
of Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics, and
creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.
The spell does not destroy or dispel existing
enchantments, nor will it affect magical creatures, constructs, or undead beyond possibly suppressing some of their abilities. It will not prevent
touch-delivered special attack forms such as a
lich's paralyzing touch. Holy water is not magical
and is fully effective within the shell.
Should the caster be larger than the area
enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person may
be considered exposed, at the DM's option. A dispel magic spell does not remove the spell; the
caster can end it upon command.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Antipathy-Sympathy
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 8
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: 2 hrs./level
Area of Effect. 1 item only or 10-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: Special
This spell allows the wizard to set certain
vibrations to emanate from an object or location
that tend to either repel or attract a specific type
of intelligent creature or characters of a particular
alignment. The wizard must decide which effect
is desired with regard to what creature type or
alignment before beginning the spellcasting, for
the components of each application differ. The
spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
Antipathy: This spell causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering
urge to leave the area or to not touch the affected
item. If a saving throw vs. spell is successful, the
creature can stay in the area or touch the item, but
the creature will feel very uncomfortable, and a
persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of
1 point of Dexterity per round (for the spell's
duration), subject to a maximum loss of 4 points
and a minimum Dexterity of 3. Failure to save vs.
spell forces the being to abandon the area or item,
shunning it utterly and never willingly returning
to it until the spell is removed or expires.
The material component for this application of
the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar.
Sympathy: By casting the sympathy application
of the spell, the wizard can cause a particular type
of creature or alignment of character to feel elated
and pleased to be in an area or touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area
or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the
object. If the saving throw is successful, the creature or character is released from the enchantment,
but a subsequent saving throw must be made 1d6
turns later. If this saving throw fails, the affected
creature will return to the area or object.
The material components of this spell are 1,000
gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop of honey.
Note that the particular type of creature to be
affected must be named specifically—for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasu,
catoblepases, vampires, etc. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named—for example,
chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true
neutral, etc.
If this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot cube
can be enchanted for each experience level of the
caster. If an object or item is enchanted, only that
single thing can be enchanted; affected creatures
or characters save vs. spell with a —2 penalty.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Apparition
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell transforms the recipient's face into a
horrible and terrifying mask. The caster can create nearly any combination of hideous features—
blue skin, parrot face, elephantine nose, or rotting
tusks. The spell does not allow the caster to duphcate the appearance of any known creature,
although portions from differing creatures can be
combined to create something new.
The effect of this apparition is startling to the
unprepared and those of little experience. The
apparition increases the surprise chance of opponents by +1 in situations where surprise is rolled.
Creatures with 1 Hit Die or level and less must
make a successful saving throw vs. spell or flee in
fright for 1d3 rounds at the sight of the horrific
apparition. However, the spell does not distinguish between friend and foe, affecting all (even
the recipient) who look upon it. If the spell is cast
upon an unwilling victim (to then be sent back to
his comrades), the victim is allowed a saving
throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
The material component for this spell is a
miniature palette dotted with paints of assorted
colors.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; very rare
elsewhere.

Arachnophobia — Neogi
(illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature/level in a 10-ft. sphere
Saving Throw: Neg.
Upon casting this spell, a neogi creates the illusion of thousands upon thousands of crawling
spiders. Only a number of creatures equal to the
level of the caster can be affected by this illusion,
and all must be within a 10-foot diameter sphere.
Any creature targeted by the spell must save vs.
spell, success indicating that the spell has no
effect. Any creature failing its initial save must
save vs. spell again. Success indicates the creature flees from the area at its fastest possible
movement rate for 2~5 rounds. Those who fail are
so frightened that they are unable to do anything
except try to remove the spiders they believe are
crawling all over their bodies.
The illusion this spell creates is different for
each individual. It might be argued that, for
example, umber hulks have little to fear from spiders. But when those spiders are 1 foot in diame-
33 XArcane Contention
ter with armor-piercing fangs, there is much to
fear. The neogi tend to use this spell to disrupt
and disorganize enemy forces when boarding
actions are taking place.
Note: Regarding the initial saving throw, DMs
must decide whether the target creature has reason to believe that what he is witnessing is an
illusion. It is not unreasonable to assign a beneficial modifier to the initial save roll if the target
has reason not to believe in the illusory spiders.
Notes: Common for neogi; rare for drow; very
rare for others. (Updated from Dr4con Magazine.)

Arcane Runes
(Alteration)
(Geometry)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: Special
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Parchment or book
Saving Throw: None
When this power is used, an Arcane—or a wizard trained in the use of their runes—can inscribe
a message or longer text, hiding it invisibly
within a scroll, book, or tome. The user might
write a warning within a large normal or magical
text, send a letter with secret information hidden
between the lines, or even write an entire book
within another volume.
The Arcane runes spell is similar to the Ist-level
wizard spell, wizard mark, but the runes do not
show up when a detect magic spell is used. They
can be seen with true seeing or by anyone casting
the read Arcane runes spell. The race of Arcane,
spelljamming traders extraordinary, can read their
runes on sight; they are the only ones who can do
so without specific training or magical aid.
The material components of this spell are a pinch
of dried and powdered lemon anda stylus. No pigment is necessary, The caster must mouth the words
(not necessarily loudly) as the verbal component. In
longer texts, a single Arcane runes spell can be
used, the casting time ending when the caster closes
the book or scroll he is working on. When an
Arcane uses this spell, the material component is
just a stylus—no verbal component is required.
Notes: Rare in spelljamming cultures; virtually
unknown elsewhere. (Updated from Dunczon
Magazine.)

Archveult's Skybolt
(Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 10 ft./level
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: 4-ft. diam. bolt, 10 ft. long/level
Saving Throw:
The spellcaster creates a luminescent bolt of
energy by hurling a crystalline focus at a target
creature or location up to 10 feet away per caster
level. Beginning 10 feet from the caster, a skybolt
4 feet in diameter bursts into existence, flashing
outward along the crystal's path.
The bolt ends where the crystal stops. A bolt
will not form in water and, if the crystal has
struck a barrier, the bolt will stop at the point of
impact. If the crystal enters an area of magical
protection that would not allow formation of the
bolt, the bolt will form instantaneously to that
point and dissipate immediately. Otherwise, the
bolt remains in existence and dangerous through
a second round and then fades away.
Any creature struck directly by the crystal (this
requires the caster to make an attack roll as if hurling a missile), suffers 1d6 pomts of damage for each
level or Hit Die it possesses, to a maximum of 1046.
A saving thow vs. spell is allowed for half damage.
Such a creature might try to catch and return
the crystal (at success chances determined by the
DM). The creature still takes damage and is
allowed a saving throw, but must also make a system shock survival roll. Its throw determines the
future path of the skybolt. The potential maximum length of the skybolt cannot exceed 10 feet
per level of the caster.
If the caster misses with a throw, refer to the
grenadelike missile scatter diagram (DMG).
Any living creature coming into contact with
the bolt but not struck by the crystal will suffer
1d4 points of shock damage per Hit Dice or level
it possesses, to a maximum of 10d4.
A skybolt lasts for two rounds. Once formed it
cannot be deflected, grounded, or insulated
against, save by antimagic effects or magic resistance. Creatures and objects entering the skybolt
will not affect it.
The material component of the spell is a crystalline focus that is at least 1 inch long. This may
be a faceted gem, a piece of quartz, or cut glass.
It is hurled as the caster completes the incantation 1
of the spell. 1
Notes: Uncommon or rare spell.

Argaster's Cloak of Shadows
(Ulusion/Phantasm)
(Shadow)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1d4+2 rds.
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell obscures the recipient with an evershifting, roiling webwork of intangible, dark
shadows. Argaster 's cloak of shadows veils the
creature's face, overall appearance, and precise
location (although a caster using the cloak can
reveal his face or hide it, whenever desired).
The affected creature gains a 2-point bonus to
his Armor Class (for example, AC 6 becomes
AC 4) and missile weapons aimed at the creature suffer a —1 penalty to attack rolls. Evard's
black tentacles and web spells immediately
negate and are destroyed by Argaster's cloak of
shadows on contact. Thieves and like individuals cloaked by the spell gain a +5% bonus to
their hide in shadows ability.
The material components of this spell are a bit
of cobweb and a pinch of dust.
Notes: Rare or very rare spell. (Updated from
DAGON Magazine.)

Armor
(Conjuration)
(Force)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Until destroyed by damage
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard creates a
magical field of force that serves asif it were
scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has no effect
on a person already armored or a creature with
Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with
the shield spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield
bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight
or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative
damage totaling greater than 8 points +1 per level
of the caster. (It is important to note that the
armor does not absorb this damage. The armor
merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers
full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus,
the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack,
then several minutes later sustain an additional 1
point of damage. Unless the spell was cast by a
wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the armor
spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor
Class gained.
The material component is a piece of finely
cured leather that has been blessed bya priest.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Army — Old Empire
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Earth)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 2 turns/level
Area of Effect: 250-ft. radius, raises
10 soldiers/4 levels
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster is able to create an instant army, which rises from the ground
in the form of earth, stone, or sand soldiers.
The caster can summon one unit of 10 soldiers
for every four levels he possesses (round all fractions down). The units must appear within a 250-
yard radius, placed as the caster sees fit. When
the spell duration expires, the surviving units
vanish. At the base caster level, this means 40
soldiers will be created for 6 hours.
The material component of this spell is a diamond of at least 5,000 gp value, which must be
crushed in the casting.
Notes: Uncommon for conjurers; rare for
others. As a ForGorTen Realms Old Empire spell,
initial exposure requires a mentor or a read
Southern magic spell.
Soldiers: AC 4; MV 3; HD 2; THAC0 19;
#AT 1; Dmg 1d6+2; SD +1or better weapon
to hit; MR 20%. They are immune to all
enchantment/charm spells; they serve only
the summoner.

Arnvid's Unseen Limb
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr./level.
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When Arnvids unseen limb is cast, the wizard
causes an invisible limb (arm, hand, leg, or foot) to
come into being. This limb can replace a missing
limb or it can be used to create an extra one. The
invisible limb functions exactly as a normal limb,
except that at the option of the recipient of the
spell, parts of it can become immaterial so as to
pass through solid objects. For example, the limb
could be used to uncork a potion inside a closed
chest and dump the bottle out, but it could not
remove the potion from the chest. It cannot pass
magical force barriers such as a wall of force, and
it is hedged out by protection from evil. The limb
cannot be made material inside a solid object.
The limb has normal touch sensations. It can be
used to wield a weapon onlyif the limb is replacing a missing arm or hand. The limb bestows no
extra senses other than touch, so it cannot be used,
for example, to add a second shield arm in the
middle of the recipient's back. The invisible limb
has no hit points or Armor Class as such, and it
cannot be harmed unless it is dispelled.
The material component of the spell is the tail
of a lizard (any type that regenerates lost body
parts). This is touched to the place on the body
where the limb is to be restored.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from Dracon
Magazine.)

Arrow of Bone
(Necromancy) ;
(Artifice) Ms
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 missile
Saving Throw: Special
By drawing runes of dire power upon a simple
arrow, bolt, dart, or javelin, the caster changes the
weapon intoa sinister missile of cold, enchanted
bone. The wizard may then throw or fire the
weapon in the normal fashion, or he can choose
to give it to a companion to use. If the wizard
employs the arrow of bone himself, he strikes
with the THAC0 of a warrior of half his own level
and a +3 bonus to his attack roll; if he gives it to
someone else, the bone arrow merely confers a
+1 bonus to hit. A creature struck by the weapon
must make a saving throw vs. death magic or die;
even if successful, the victim sustains normal
damage for the missile, plus an additional number of points equal to the weapon's maximum
damage (for example, 1d6+6 for an arrow or
javelin, or 1d3+3 for a dart). Unlike the death
spell or finger of death, the victim can be raised
or resurrected in any expedient manner.
The arrow of bone does not destroy undead or
nonliving creatures outright. Instead, the arrow
inflicts normal damage plus four times the missile's normal maximum (1d6+24 for an arrow,
1d3+12 for a dart, and so on), or half that if the
subject creature succeeds in its saving throw.
The material component is a powdered sliver
of bone mixed with black dragon blood. The
resulting mixture is used to paint runes on the
weapon. If the splinter of bone can be taken from
the remains of a close blood relative of the subject (a sibling, parent, or grandparent), the victim
Teceives a —4 penalty on his or her saving throw if
struck by the arrow of bone.
Notes: Common for necromancers, artificers,
and some Savage mages; otherwise rare (PO:SM).

Arrowflight — Pluma
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1-6 rd.
Duration: 3 turns/level
Area of Effect: 3 archers/level
Saving Throw: None
This enchantment can be cast onto one or more
archers, to a maximum of 30 archers at 10th level.
For the duration of the spell, the range of the
archers is doubled for short, medium, and long
ranges. In addition, the arrows inflict +1 point of
damage for each successful hit. It cannot be used
to augment any other type of missile weapon,
including spears, slings, or crossbows. It does not
add to other magical bonuses for range or damage,
nor is the damage bonus itself magical.
The material component for the spell is a bit of
downfeather, trimmed into the shape of an arrow's
fletching.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Articus's Devolutionary Warrior
(Chronomancy)
Level: 5
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 5 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 human, demihuman, or
humanoid
Saving Throw: Neg.
When this spell is cast, the evolutionary clock of
the affected being is reversed—its fighting ability
increases at the cost of its mind. The recipient gains
1d6 in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution (maximums of 19), while losing 3d6 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (minimums of 1). Nails and
teeth become sharper and usable as weapons. There
is a marked increase in body hair, and body changes
might be noticed (longer arms, hunched posture).
At any Intelligence below 5, the creature shuns
weapons for a claw/claw/bite attack (1d2/1d2/1d4;
if a creature already has these attacks, add +1/+1/+2
damage). A saving throw vs. spell is granted if the
subject is unwilling. When the spell ends, the subject must make a system shock check or remain in
the devolved state (this condition is reversible with
a limited wish or equivalent).
For an unknown reason, Articus s devolutionary warrior does not work on elves. Most chronomancers believe elves were created whole without
evolution, rather than with an innate resistance.
Half-elves gain 1d3 in Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution and lose only 246 in Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma.
The material component for this spell is the
tooth of a gorilla or carnivorous ape.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Articus's Melee Manager
(Chronomancy)
Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By use of this spell, the chronomancer manipulates time so that the recipient gains more use out
of a single combat round. The creature does not
move faster, but this extra time grants several
bonuses. The creature gains one extra melee
7 57 XKAy Aryeric's Cloak of Protection
attack for every five levels of the chronomancer
(up to four total attacks). Also, a1 adjustment is
applied to the creature's initiative roll, surprise
roll, and Armor Class due to the extra attention
that can be paid to these details.
The material component required is a drop of
mercury. This spell is not cumulative with itself or
any other spell granting extra attacks. Also, it does
not allow for casting of more than one spell per
round or the use of more than one magical item.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Aryeric's Cloak of Protection
(Abjuration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is used, a translucent image of the
caster appears and swells to cover the area of effect.
A number of creatures equal to the caster's level
plus one within the area of effect can be protected.
Those under the cloak save vs. spell as the caster, up
to the saving throw of a 12th-level wizard (an 8).
In addition, the caster can transfer damage
incurred by spells from one creature or individual to
another protected by the cloak. (For example, if a
priest under the cloak is struck by a magic missile,
the wizard who cast Aryeric's cloak of protection
can instead direct that damage against a fighter who
is also protected by the cloak.) This can be done
once per round, and damage cannot be split among
the protected creatures, If the creature receiving the
damage dies, the spell is instantly broken.
The cloak moves with the caster, and anyone
moving outside the spell's radius is no longer protected, even if he re-enters later.
The material component is a strip of cloth
soaked in ink.
Notes: Rare or very rare spell. (Updated from
POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Assist — Red Wizards
(Conjuration, Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd. +1 rd /level
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of this spell gains 1d8 temporary
hit points. These additional hit points can exceed
the character's normal total and are the first lost
in combat. These extra hit points cannot be
regained by curative magic. This spell also is
used in creation of a potion of heroism.
The material component is a small vial of pungent herbs, the scent of which the recipient must
inhale.
Notes: Common for necromancers and Red
Wizards of Thay; otherwise rare.

Astral Spell
(Evocation)
(Universal)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 9
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of the astral spell, a wizard can project his astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving
his physical body and material possessions
behind in the Prime Material Plane. Only magical
items can be brought into the Astral Plane
(although nonmagical items could be rendered
temporarily magical through the use of spells
such as Nystuls magic aura if the DM allows). As
the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of
all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel
astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The
caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a
body in the plane of existence he has chosen to
enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of
the astral spell, but a second body cannot be
formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general
rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only
by creatures in the Astral Plane.
At all times, the astral body is connected to the
material body bya silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and
materially; however, normally only a psychic
wind can cause the cord to break. When a second
body is formed in a different plane, the silvery
cord remains invisibly attached to the new body.
If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns
to the original body where it rests in the Prime
Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.
Although astrally projected persons are able
to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do
not affect creatures not existing in the Astral
Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to
end it, or until it is terminated by some outside
means (such as a dispel magic spell or the
destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime
Material Plane).
The wizard can project the astral forms of up
to seven other creatures with him by means of the
astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in
acircle with the wizard. These fellow travelers
are dependent upon the wizard and can be
stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or
fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the PLANESCAPE
Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.)
Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane,
but most become temporarily nonmagical therein,
or in any planes removed from the Prime Material
Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might
function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing
their power from a given plane are more powerful
in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance
in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life
stealing in the Negative Energy plane).
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Attract Ghoul
(Necromancy)
Level. 2
Range: 1 mi/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2d12 hrs.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 ghoul
Saving Throw: Special
This spell summons a ghoul to act as the
necromancer's aide and familiar. The caster can
converse easily with the ghoul and shares an
empathic link with the monster. He can issue it
mental commands at a range of up to 1 mile,
receiving emotional responses—anger, fear,
hunger—in return. The ghoul is willing to serve
as a guard, scout, or spy, undertaking any task
demanded, but in return the necromancer must
keep the ghoul well-fed and provide it with a
defensible lair of the appropriate kind. Should
the necromancer fail to meet these conditions,
the ghoul wanders off and resumes its normal
activities. There is a 5% chance to attract a
ghast, which will attack unless the caster is 6th
level or higher, but which will otherwise serve
as a ghoul.
The summoned ghoul is an exceptionally
intelligent and strong specimen, with at least 10
hit points and average Intelligence instead of
low. A necromancer can have no more than one
ghoul servant bound to him at any one time by
this spell, and it will tend to not get along with
any other familiar the necromancer might have.
Any ghouls created by the necromancer's servant are not under the necromancer's control
and might attack him unless he is with his servant ghoul.
If the ghoul remains more than 1 mile distant
from the necromancer for a full week, the
empathic link is broken and the ghoul is no
longer bound to serve (although it may be favorably disposed towards its former master if treated
well). If the ghoul is destroyed, the necromancer
is immediately aware of the creature's demise and
must make a system shock check; failure means
incapacitation for 1d6 hours.
The spell requires a censer full of myrrh and
bitter herbs worth at least 500 gp. It may or may
not succeed in attracting a ghoul, depending on
whether or not one is in range; the chance of success is 10%, plus 5% per level. The attract ghoul
spell is an unusually taxing and powerful enchantment, and can be cast only once per year.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Audible Glamer
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
(Song)
Level: 1
Range: 60 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Tim
Duration: 3 rds./level
Area of Effect: Hearing range
Saving Throw: Special
When the audible glamer spell is cast, the wizard
causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede,
approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The
volume of sound created, however, is directly
related to the level of the spellcaster. The volume is
based upon the lowest level at which the spell can
be cast, Ist level. The noise of the audible glamer at
this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like
volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the
spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus,
talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or
running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume
must be commensurate with the level of the wizard
casting the spell. A horde of rats running and
squeaking is about the same volume as eight men
running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the
noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is
equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.
A character stating that he does not believe the
sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds,
the character then hears a faint and obviously
false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.
The material component of the spell is a bit of
wool or a small lump of wax.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Augment Undead
Reversible (Necromancy) anf"
Level: 3
Range: 40 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 turn + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 undead creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell augments an undead creature's saving
throws and ability to resist being turned. It can be
cast only upon an undead creature with at least 3
Hit Dice fewer than the caster has levels. The
undead is then treated as if3 Hit Dice stronger for
saving throws and for resisting turning attempts.
Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
Casting this spell on the Demiplane of Dread
requires a RAVENLOFT powers check.
The casting requires a piece of clothing from
any undead creature, such as a zombie or wight.
It can be reused indefinitely.
The reverse of this spell, diminish undead,
requires the undead creature to roll a saving
throw vs. spell. It can be cast upon any undead
creature. If the saving throw fails, the undead
creature saves and is turned as if it had 3 Hit Dice
less than its true value. Multiple castings of the
spell are not cumulative.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and undead
spellcasters. Common in the RAVENLOFT setting;
otherwise very rare.

Augmentation I
(Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous 1
Area of Effect: 1 spell
Saving Throw: None
This spell augments the damage inflicted by
any spell of Ist to 3rd level. For each die ofdamage rolled, the caster adds one point to the damage total.
The augmentation J spell affects only one
spell, cast on the round immediately following
the augmentation. If an entire round or more
elapses, the augmentation is wasted.
Only spells that cause direct physical damage
are affected by augmentation; for example, monsters gained through monster summoning I gain
no bonuses to their damage.
The material component is a pair of concentric
circles of bronze or silver.
Notes: Uncommon spell (ToM).

Augmentation II
(Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 3 turns
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell functions exactly like the 3rd-level
augmentation I spell except that five spells of Ist
to 3rd level can be affected. For each die of damage caused by augmented spells, one point is
added to the damage total. The augmentation
affects the first five spells that cause direct damage that are cast within the duration of the augmentation II spell. Only spells that cause direct
physical damage are affected by this spell.
The material component is a pair of concentric
circles of gold or platinum.
Notes: Uncommon spell (7M).

Aunty's Bath
(Conjuration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 hr.
Area of Effect: 100 gallons/level
Saying Throw: None
The spell causes a water source to instantly
become soapy. Unseen hands scrub bubbles upon
all living matter in the water. The hands and soap
disappear when the spell duration runs out.
This spell was created by the old wizard Aunty
Carlys, who often found herself taking care of
adventurers' children. The children were not fond
of baths, and Aunty discovered that if she lured
them into a small pond on the pretext of swimming, she could cast this spell and make them
clean. Aunty's bath is a derivative of the unseen
servant and conjure elemental spells. Aunty's
bath is especially good for washing dogs, odorous friends, and pesky water-based monsters.
The material component is a bar of soap.
Notes: Rare spell. (Updated from POLYHEDRON
Newszine.)

Aura
(Divination)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 mi. diam./level
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a wu jen to read the aura of
an area, determining the basic alignment and
magical tendencies of most of the inhabitants and
items in the area. When cast, an aura appears over
every dwelling or structure within the area of
effect, indicating whether most of the principal
occupants are good, evil, lawful, neutral, or
chaotic. In addition, areas with a high concentration of unwarded magic are also revealed.
For example, standing on a hill overlooking a
village, the wu jen casts this spell. Each house in
the village begins to glow, indicating the primary
nature of its inhabitants. Thus, the wu jen is able
to note the homes of good people, evildoers, and
lawful types. Temples and shrines have a magical
glow because they are more predisposed to magic
than other areas. Likewise, haunted and cursed
areas have an appropriate aura. The aura even
appears over dwellings the caster cannot directly
see—a faint glow over the treetops might indicate
a hut or cave deep in the woods.
The reverse of this spell, mask, hides the aura
of any one dwelling from detection by the aura
spell. The reverse lasts a full week.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise
rare.

Aura Fire — Red Wizard
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 80 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 4 rds,/level
Area of Effect: 12 linear ft./level in a 40-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell is very similar to the Ist-level priest
spell faerie fire. It enables the caster to outline one
or more objects or creatures with a pale reddish
light (a different color from the priest effect). The
numberof subjects outlined depends upon the
number of feet the caster can affect. Sufficient
footage enables several objects or creatures to be
outlined, but each must be fully outlined before the
next is begun, and all must be within the area of
effect. Outlined objects or creatures are visible at
80 yards in the dark, 40 yards if the viewer is near a
bright light source. Outlined creatures are easier to
strike in poor lighting, thus opponents gain a +2
bonus to attack rolls in darkness (including moonlit
nights) and a +1 bonus in twilight or better.
Note that outlining can render otherwise invisible
creatures visible. However, this spell cannot outline
noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous creatures. Nor
does the light come anywhere close to sunlight, and
thus has no special effect on undead or darkdwelling creatures. The aura fire does not cause any
harm to the object or creature thus outlined.
The wizard must make motions in the air with
both hands as if outlining the body to be outlined
with light.
Notes: Restricted to the Red Wizards of Thay
and those trained by them; common.

Aura of Terror — Dragon
(illusion/Phantasm)
Level 2
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
By using this spell, a dragon enhances its abil- 1
ity to strike terror in creatures subject to its fear 1
aura. See the general "Dragon" entry of the
Monstrous MANUAL Tome for an overview of
the details of dragon fear.
When the spell is cast, the dragon weaves an
illusion that enhances its image of rage and battle
experience: multiple battle scars, altered or disfigured features, longer spine-spikes, fangs, and
talons, and so on, All this makes the dragon seem 1
even more menacing than usual. The illusion cannot change the dragon's size or species, but the
spell does make the dragon seem older. 1
Once the spell is cast, the dragon gains two age 1
categories for purposes of determining the range,
saving throw, and effect of its fear aura. Young
and juvenile dragons gain a fear aura that they 1
would normally not be entitled to; older dragons
gain a more powerful aura.
Because of the shift in effective age category, 1
ing throws against the fear aura of dragons of
‘young adult" age and older suffer a —2 penalty.
Thus, the usually unmodified saving throw for a
dragon of old age becomes a saving throw with a
—2 penalty, a great wyrm dragon's aura inflicts a 1
5 penalty, and so forth. 1
Furthermore, the enhanced powerof the aura 1
allows the dragon to strike panic into creatures of
up to 2 Hit Dice and fear into creatures that normally would be unaffected (that is, those with up
to two more levels or Hit Dice than the dragon).
The dragon need not concentrate to maintain
an aura of terror and can engage in other actions
a as desired (for example, combat, using its breath
as weapon, or casting additional spells). The dragon
Hepa \ ; can end the spell at will.
Creatures attempting to disbelieve the illusion
gain a saving throw vs. spell to negate the aura.
Evenif this is successful, however, normal saving
throws against the dragon's regular fear aura still
apply. Detect magic can indicate the presence of
an aura of terror, and a successful dispel magic
can remove it
This spell is popular among younger, weaker
dragons, though dragons of all ages and types
\\ Avissar's Bane gg
have been known to use it. While nondragon versions of this spell have yet to surface, other spellcasting creatures who produce a fear aura (such
as liches) have shown interest in the aura of terror spell.
Notes: Restricted to dragons; uncommon.

Avert Evil Eye
(Alteration, Reversible Universal)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 24 hrs./level
Area of Effect: 1 object and creature
Saving Throw: None
This is a common and popular spell in the
Land of Fate. The danger of the evil eye is everpresent, and the wise and the cautious often seek
Protection from its glare.
Avert evil eye protects one creature against this
danger. The wizard casts the spell upon a single
blue bead made of glass, while voicing the recipient's common name (or identity). The caster must
touch the bead, but he needn't touch the recipient.
The bead is then sewn into the fabric of the recipient's outer clothing, or crushed and placed in the
recipient's drink. Most rulers with a wizard handy
prefer the latter method; the outward show of
such a bead might be construed as fear, and a
wise emir does not show fear to his people.
As long as the bead is in the recipient's possession or for the duration of the spell, if it's imbibed—
any check against the evil eye is automatically
effective. Further, avert evil eye provides a +1
bonus to all saving throws vs. enchantment/charm
magic. It also provides a +2 saving throw bonus vs.
the effects of the curse and bestow curse spells. It
offers no protection against a curse wrought by
other means (magical or otherwise).
The reverse of this spell, attract evil eye,
requires a black bead instead of blue. The target is
allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if it succeeds, he
is immune and the bead is worthless. If the saving
throw fails, the target attracts the evil eye automatically, regardless of his own modesty and
humility, with all ill effects as noted for this foul
curse (-2 penalty to saving throws, ability checks,
and proficiency checks; new encounters are
"indifferent" at best). In addition, the recipient of
the reverse spell suffers a —1 penalty to all saving
throws vs. enchantment/charm spells, as well as a
—2 penalty when saving vs. all curses (not just
those created by the spell).
Avert evil eye negates the effects of attract evil
eye, but only if it precedes the latter. Once the
evil eye is upon the victim, only stronger magic
such as remove curse or quest can remove it.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise
very rare.

Avissar's Bane
(Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell infuses the creature touched with diabolic heat energy from the outer plane of Ba'ator.
Avissar's bane can be cast but once per week due to
the strain it places on the spellcaster. The spellcaster
must touch his victim (a successful attack roll). The
spell affects any single creature, except the following: A creature that can be hit only by magical
‘weapons is immune; an undead, fire-based, or extraplanar creature cannot be affected; and the creature's
whose Hit Dice or level exceeds the spellcaster's
level will not be affected. There is no saving throw;
however, magic resistance is effective.
The victim of Avissar''s bane suffers the following effects:
* The creature's hit point total is reduced to 1; thus,
any wound results in unconsciousness or death.
+ The creature is in constant agony; the sensation
is that of being burned alive, and the victim
sweats continuously.
* The creature is exhausted, and has attack and
damage roll penalties of 4.
+ Each hour, creature has a 15% chance (noncumulative) to be overcome by pain and lose
unconsciousness, only to awaken 1d4 hours
later, in agony. If the creature engages in combat, spellcasting, or other strenuous activity
for more than 15 rounds (minutes) in any single hour, this chance increases to 40%. Further, the victim has a 1% cumulative chance
for death each round over the limit (1% the
16th round, 2% the 17th round, 3% the 18th,
and so on).
These effects are continuous and end only with
the death of the victim. The effects cannot be
negated, save by an act of the gods, a wish spell,
or by the will of the original caster. The learning
and casting of this spell is an evil act. Use of this
spell might entail severe alignment consequences.
The archmage Avissar is also said to have personally devised this deadly enchantment; further,
it is said that the archmage met his death on the
vengeful point of a sword wielded by the brother
of the spell's first victim.
The material components are a drop of oil, a
pinch of sulphur, a powdered ruby of at least
5,000 gp value, and the horn of a greater baatezu
(cornugon, gelugon, or pit fiend).
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in the Fire-Eye
Scrolls. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Avissar's Flaming Weapon
(Alteration)
(Artifice, Fire)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 weapon
Saving Throw: None
The archmage Avissar himself created a spell
that can cause any nonmagical, hand-held, bladed
weapon to perform with the powers of a sword,
+1 flame tongue (see the DMG, magical item
descriptions) Thus, the weapon temporarily gains
a+] enchantment and has a +2 bonus vs. regenerating creatures, +3 vs. cold-using, flammable, or
avian creatures, and +4 vs. undead. The weapon
sheds light upon command, and its flame easily
ignites oil, burns webs, and sets fire to parchment, paper, dry wood, etc. The wizard can cast
this spell on another's weapon as easily as on his
own. If cast upon weapons other than swords
(cutlasses, daggers, knives, etc.), the base damage
of the weapon is retained, and the magical
bonuses are simply added to it.
The material component is a rubyof at least
1,000 gp value, which vanishes when the spell's
duration expires.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in the FireEye Scrolls (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Avoidance
(Abjuration, Alteration)
Reversible
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds.
Components: ¥, S,
Casting Time:
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: Up to 3-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the caster sets up a natural repulsion between the affected object and all
other living things except himself. Thus, any living creature attempting to touch the affected
object is repulsed (unable to come closer than 1
foot), or repulses the affected object, depending
on the relative mass of the two (a halfling attempting to touch an iron chest with an avoidance spell
upon it will be thrown back, while the chest will
skitter away from a giant-sized creature as the
creature approaches).
‘The material component for the spell is a magnetized needle. The spell cannot be cast upon living things; any attempt to cast an avoidance spell
upon the apparel or items carried bya living creature entitles the subject creature to a saving throw
vs. spell to avoid the effect.
The reverse of this spell, attraction, uses the
same material components and sets up a natural
attraction between the affected object and all living things. A creature is drawn to the object if the
creature is smaller, or the object slides toward the
creature if the creature is larger. It takes a successful bend bars/lift gates roll to remove the
enchanted object once it has adhered to an object
or creature.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Awaken Intelligence
(Alteration) or
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4 hrs.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This potent one-time dweomer gives sapience
toa creature of animal Intelligence or less. If the
creature survives a system shock roll, roll 346 for
its new Intelligence score. If the creature's Constitution is unknown, use 70% + 1% per Hit Die
to see if it survives. Awakened intelligence may
not be passed on to offspring unless "locked" into
the creature's genetic makeup with the alter beast
spell. The process is excruciatingly painful for
the creature. It is also so taxing that the caster can
cast no spell greater than 3rd level for 24 hours
after this spell is used without also making a system shock survival check.
The process might work on creatures of semi-
‘intelligence or better; that is, an Intelligence ability score of2 or more. This spell allows one reroll
for Intelligence with 346. If the Intelligence score
does not improve, it decreases by 1. The subject
also must pass a system shock roll for survival.
Regardless of the outcome, no creature can
undergo this process more than once; the only
result of repeating the process is additional system shock checks. Once completed, the effects
‘cannot be changed by any magic short of a full
1 wish,
Preparations: The spell is cast at the conclu-
‘sion of preparations that take at least one full
week. A laboratory is necessary, as well as some
Provision for immobilizing the subject or rendering it unconcious.
The material components are a dried fish and a
jece of brain coral.
P Notes: Very rare spell.

Azure Flame — Paramander
(Alteration)
Level: 5
Range: 50 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
The azure flame spell causes all creatures
within the area of effect to burst into blue flame.
A successful saving throw vs. spell negates the
effect. The azure flame burns until extinguished
by dispel magic—nothing else affects it—and
spreads to any living thing touched. Lifeless
items (including undead and constructs) do not
burn, Burning creatures take 1d4 points of damage per round until the flame is dispelled; a successful dispel magic spell extinguishes the flame,
as will remove curse. Also any priest spell above
3rd level that extinguishes magical fire will be
effective. Creatures reduced to —10 hit points by
the flame crumble into a pile of blue ash from
which they cannot be resurrected,
This spell is cast by paramanders (a very rare
type of paladin/mage) acting in direct service to
their deity, and represents wielding raw energy
from the deity itself. Casting this spell except
under the most exacting conditions of directly
furthering the deity's aims will afflict the casting
paramander and none other with the effects. It is
exceedingly dangerous to cast it more than once
per month.
The material component of the spell is a small
piece of azurite rubbed between the fingers of
one hand while the other hand performs the complicated somatic gestures. The spell requires a
Dexterity of 13 or higher.
Notes: Restricted to paramanders; uncommon.
Known efforts by others to duplicate this spell
have all ended badly. (Updated from Dracon
Magazine.)

Backblast — Phaerimm
(Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to hurl back spells
involving flames or fiery explosions (only; not
heat alone, or lightning-like electrical energy discharges) at their source(s). Magical item effects
and even the most powerful spells (such as
meteor swarm) are affected. The spell protects a
single creature, usually the caster, but it can be
another touched during spellcasting; once casting
is complete, the protection cannot be transferred.
Otherwise, it exists as an invisible aura around
the protected creature, operating without any concentration and without disturbing subsequent spellcasting by the protected creature. When a fiery spell
attack strikes, the backblast functions automatically;
the recipient cannot choose to take the damage and
keep the protection for later. However, the spell also
prevents any disruption of casting or other activity
by the protected creature and protects all flammable
items on the creature from harm; they need not
make saving throws against fire-based attacks.
Once activated, a backblast spell works for a
single round and then ends. It reflects back all
fiery attacks in that round: for example, several
different fireballs. A backblast will send a spell
back (a delayed blast fireball, for instance) over
vast distances to a source who has left the scene—
but can't follow a source onto another plane. In
such cases, the attacking magic is negated.
Once cast, this spell continues until it is activated, dispel magic is cast on the protected creature, it expires after one turn plus 1 turn per level,
or until the creature dies or moves from one plane
of existence to another.
Notes: Restricted to Phaerimm; common.

Backlash — Drow
(Abjuration, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration. Permanent until triggered
Area of Effect: 1 spellcaster
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this special curse, a wizard can
make another spellcaster's magic backfire. The
victim can avoid the backlash effect when it is
initially cast by making a successful saving throw
vs. spell. If the saving throw is failed, there is no
immediate result, except that a faint magical trace
of the casting can be detected.
The backlash spell is triggered by one of three
events, regardless of the distance or time from the
placement of the backlash spell:
* The subject employs an offensive spell that fails
because the target creature made its saving throw;
* The subject casts an offensive spell that is
somehow interrupted or ruined;
+ The subject uses an offensive spell against a
creature that is immune to it.
The backlash causes the offensive spell to
work with full effect upon the caster, disregarding
all saving throws or immunities the caster might
have. The backlash effect works only once. Ifa
caster is subject to more than one backlash spell,
only one takes effect at a time.
The spell has no effect on nonspellcasters, on natural spell-like powers, or on magical devices. It can
be removed only by a remove curse or stronger spell;
the dispel magic spell or 1ts equivalent is ineffective.
Notes: Common for drow; otherwise very rare.
Known to be in The Shadowtome.

Bafflement — Pluma
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, $
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 being
Saving Throw: Neg
By use of this spell, the caster can make someone he is speaking to become confused and disoriented. The baffled being is incapable of any rational
action or conversation, and will sit quietly, mumbling to himself. If the being is attacked, the spell is
broken as soon as the first damage is inflicted.
The caster and subject must be engaged in conversation for the spell to work. The caster must
make eye contact with the subject to enact this spell.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Balance
(Enchantment)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None
The balance spell enables a person (as
defined in the charm person spell) to balance on
one or both feet in a precarious position where a
fall is otherwise likely. Thus, the person can
walk a tightrope, cross a narrow or unstable
ledge, or fight near the edge of a cliff without
fear of falling. A balancing action requiring a
Dexterity check will be passed if the individual
is unhindered.
This spell does not modify the subject's Armor
Class, fighting, missile bonuses, or climbing
bonuses, though penalties to these factors due to
poor balance are negated. If other hindering factors are introduced (the being is pushed, exposed
to high winds, ice, or unusually slippery conditions, and so on) the individual may be affected,
but will have a minimum effective Dexterity for
this purpose of 15 and a +1 to +4 advantange over
an individual relying on natural balance.
The material component of the spell is a pinch
of powdered mountain goat hoof.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in Mylsibis's
Codex of Contention. (Updated from Dracon
Magazine.)

Ball Lightning
(Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 30 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creates 1 to 4 balls
Saving Throw: 4
This spell allows the caster to create up to four
glowing spheres of lightning at any time during
the spell's duration, The damage each ball inflicts
is determined by the number of balls the caster
creates. Each ball lasts no longer than 4 rounds,
regardless of when the caster chooses to bring
them into existence. The spell duration is 5
rounds per caster level.
Number of Balls Damage
Four 2d4 each
Three 2d6 each
Two Sd4 each
One 4d12
The balls are about 3 feet in diameter and
tesemble will-o-wisps, or the spell dancing
lights. The caster can move the spheres at a rate
of 4; a globe sent beyond the spell range vanishes
harmlessly. Controlling one or more lightning
balls absorbs the caster's attention for the round.
Uncontrolled balls simply hover in place. Ifa
lightning ball touches a creature, it immediately
discharges the damage shown on the table, with a
saying throw vs. spell allowed for half damage.
Noattack roll is required for the wizard to move a
ball of lightning into contact with a target, but
most creatures can avoid a lightning ball simply
by moving faster.
The material component is a powder of blue
dragon scales.
Notes: Uncommon for Air or Weather mages;
tare for others. (Updated from POLYHEDRON
Newszine.)

Ballant's Stonesplit
(Evocation)
(Earth)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 10-ft. cube/level
Saying Throw: Special
The wizard who casts this spell cleaves the
next stone object he touches. The force from his
fingertips manifests in a spray of light, creating a
thick, winding crack that appears in the stone
with considerable force. At the end of the round
following the casting, the crack reduces to rubble
an amount of stone equal to the area of effect. It
does nothing to remove the rubble, so the caster
usually must be mobile to avoid being crushed by
his own spell. The spell can be countered by a
successful dispel magic spell, cast before the
stone is actually reduced to rubble.
For example, a 12th-level wizard touches a stone
wall 100 feet long, 30 feet high, and 10 feet thick.
A 40-foot wide section of the wall is reduced to
rubble. The rubble fills the breech to a height equal
to half that of the original wall, sloping away on
each side at an angle of about 45 degrees.
If the spell is cast on a stone floor, a fissure
opens and the rubble settles quickly, dropping the
floor 1 to 4 feet and causing 1d4 points of damage to those in the area of effect.
If cast on a stone ceiling, the DM adjudicates
any damage, but this use is limited by the spell's
range (touch), and the ability of most mobile
opponents to get out of the way.
The spell causes great damage to stone-based
creatures, such as galeb duhr or xorn, If a successful touch attack is made, these take 12d8
points of damage, with a successful saving throw
vs. spell reducing the damage by half. Petrified
creatures are obliterated by this spell, though any
magical items carried survive if a successful item
saving throw vs. disintegration is made at a—4
penalty.
The material component of the spell is a single
diamond-tipped chisel worth at least 1,000 gp,
which is destroyed in the casting.
Notes: Uncommon or rare for Earth mages,
otherwise rare or very rare. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Ballant's Stonestrength
(Alteration)
(Earth)
Level: 5
Range: 20 yds.
Components; V, S, M
Casting Time:
Duration: 3 turns + 2 turns/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes any single stone structure,
no matter what its size, to increase in structural
strength by 10% per level of the caster. For
example, a 10th-level wizard casting this spell
on a stone gatehouse doubles its strength
(+100%). The stone becomes tougher and more
resistant to chipping and cracking. Any damage
done to the structure reduces the magical
strengthening first, so that even if greatly battered, the structure may escape unharmed at the
expiration of the spell.
Since this spell affects only stone, it will not
affect defenses of earth or wood. If a defensive
structure contains a significant amount of other
material, the DM can either adjudicate the effect
of attacks locally or treat the magical augmentation as a percentage: Ifa wall is 40% stone, then
the spell is 40% effective.
The spell completely repairs any stone-based
creature, such as a stone golem, xorn, galeb duhr,
and so on, but only for the duration of the spell.
Damage taken within this time is taken from the
magically repaired points first. When cast upon a
petrified individual, the spell provides virtual
immunity to incidental chipping or breakage. The
spell affects stone-creating magic, such as the
wall of stone spell.
The material components are a small granite
wedge and a pinch of powdered iron, which is
sprinkled over the wedge during the casting.
Notes: Uncommon or rare for Earth mages;
otherwise rare or very rare. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Balliard's Rejuvenating Touch
(Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
Balliard's rejuvenating touch revives an
exhausted recipient. A creature under its effect
feels as though it has had an appropriate rest
period (a night's sleep, for example) and can easily operate for 16 more hours before resting. This
spell does not allow for the recovery of lost spells
or hit points, nor does it alleviate hunger, thirst,
or illness.
An individual can remain active even longer
without sleep if a second Balliard's rejuvenating touch is received before the duration of the
first ends. However, the individual needs to
make up all the sleep missed when the second
spell ends. A human, for example, needing
eight hours of sleep every 24 hours, stays active
for 48 hours under the influence of two castings
of this spell (16 hours of wakefulness from a
normal night's sleep, 32 hours more from the
spells). At the end of the second spell's duration, the individual needs to sleep for 16 hours
to make up for two lost sleep periods. An individual subject to enough castings of this spell to
stay awake more than 48 hours straight loses 1
hit point for each eight-hour period beyond 48
hours. These hit points can be regained through
normal means.
Notes: Rare or very rare.

Bands of Ice
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special (2 turns maximum)
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to trap a
chosen creature in thick bands of ice. The caster can
create solid, icy bands able to hold a creature 1 foot
tall for every level possessed; that is, a 1 0th-level
spellcaster can capture a creature 10 feet or less tall.
If the creature is very broad, such as an umber hulk,
add 1 or 2 feet to its effective height for the purposes
of determining what the wizard can capture.
The creature receives a saving throw vs. spell to
determine the effectiveness of the bands. If the saving throw is successful, the ice is brittle and easily
broken, allowing the creature to escape in one
round. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the creature is trapped for at least one turn. Once a turn has
passed, the creature is allowed a bend bars/lift gates
roll to determine if the ice has melted to the point
where it can escape (for monsters, use 1% per Hit
Die if man-sized, 5% per Hit Die if large or huge).
If the roll is successful, the creature breaks free of
the ice and is no longer effected by the spell.
The normal duration of the bands of ice is two
turns. If the spell is cast in a cold environment
(40° F. or lower), the duration is doubled to four
turns, and if the surroundings are very cold (0° F.
or below), the duration is increased to six turns
(one hour). Applying a torch shortens the duration by one round for each round that heat is
applied. Magical fires such asa fireball melt the
ice, but injure the trapped being in the process.
‘A creature trapped in the bands of ice suffers 1d6
points of cold damage each turn. Cold-dwelling
creatures receive no damage, while fire-dwelling
creatures suffer double damage. Creatures with
high body heat, such as salamanders, melt the ice
twice as fast, halving the spell's duration.
The material components for this spell are several chain links made of nickel, a piece of iron in
the shape of a hoop, and a bit of snow.
Notes: Uncommon for Frost mages; otherwise
very rare. Known to be in The Book of Naz.
(Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Bands of Sirellyn
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Range: 40 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 turn + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The spell causes a number of shining metal
bands to materialize out of the air, encircling and
capturing a target of the caster's choice. The victim
isallowed a saving throw vs. spell to elude capture,
with a—I penalty per three caster levels (for example, -1 for a 5th to 6th level caster, —2 for 7th to
9th, -3 for 10th to 12th, and so on), since higherlevel casters conjure more bands in a denser pattern, Any creature of less than gargantuan size (G)
can be snared, but gargantuan monsters are simply
too big to be restrained by the bands.
A creature failing its saving throw vs. spell is
caught and held immobile by the bands. Arms
and legs are immobilized, but speech and psionic
Power use are possible, as may be the use of worn
magical items, such as rings. Creatures with
Strength ability scores can burst the bands and
free themselves with a successful bend bars/lift
gates roll (creatures without Strength scores save
ys. petrification with a penalty of -4).
Once employed by the mysterious ancient wizard known as the Arcanamach, this forgotten
dweomer was rediscovered by the mage Sirellyn
many centuries after its last use.
The spell requires three miniature bands of silver
that are interlocked so that all three are connected.
Notes: Uncommon spell (PO:SM).

Banish Dazzle
(Divination)
(Flame)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This magic enables the caster or another individual he touches to see clearly in or through blinding
sun, free from the effects of heat shimmer. The
recipient knows that mirages and common illusions
(the result of Sth-level spells or less) are not real.
The recipient also receives saving throw bonuses of
+4 vs. color spray, fire charm, and similar visual
spells related to color, heat, or fire.
The recipient is not hindered by reflected sunlight—whether from a mirror, shiny shield, or
other device intended to create glare. He enjoys
normal "best conditions" when making an attack
roll, for optimum missile fire and spell aiming.
The banish dazzle spell also prevents the recipient from being blinded by bright light, including
that caused by continual light and sundazzle If
the damage has already been done, the banish
dazzle spell can remove the effects of sundazzle
and /ight. It cannot, however, remove the effects
of continual light or more powerful spells, nor
can it protect the recipient against the effects of
power word blind.
The material component of this spell, consumed in the casting, is a shard of glass, gemstone, mica, or any clear crystal.
Notes: Common in arabian settings, very rare
elsewhere.

Banishment
(Abjuration)
Level: 7
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special
A banishment spell enables the caster to force
some extraplanar creature out of the caster's home
plane. The effect is instantaneous, and the subject
cannot come back without some special summoning or means of egress from its own plane to the one
from which it was banished. Up to 2 Hit Dice or levels of creature per caster level can be banished.
The caster must both name the type of creature(s)
to be sent away and give 1ts name and title as well,
ifany. In any event, the creature's magic resistance
must be overcome for the spell to be effective
The material components of the spell are sub-
stances harmful, hateful, or opposed to the nature of
1 the subject(s) of the spell. For every such substance
included in the casting, the subject creature(s) loses
5% from its magic resistance and suffers a—2
penalty to its saving throw vs. spell. For example, if
iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of rosemary
were used in casting a banishment upon a being that
hates those things, its saving throw versus the spell
would be made with a -8 penalty (four substances
times the factor of -2). Special items, such as hair
from the tail of a ki-rin or couatl feathers, could also
be added to change the factor to —3 or 4 per item.
Incontrast, a titan's hair or mistletoe blessed by a
druid might lower the factor to —1 with respect to
the same creature. If the subject creature successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is
stung by a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 points of
damage, and is stunned for one round.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Bargain
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
\ Barriet ge
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 spirit
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is used by the wu jen to obtain the services of lesser and greater spirits. Before the spell
is cast, the wu jen must contact the desired spirit
(through a commune spell) Once the contact has
been made, the wu jen can cast the bargain spell. If
the spirit makes a successful saving throw vs. spell,
the spell fails and the spirit is under no compulsion
to heed the wu jen. However, if the saving throw is
failed, the wu jen can demand one service of the
spirit, if that service is within the powers of the
spirit. The spirit is compelled to perform this service if the wu jen can close the deal by providing
some item or service demanded by the spirit.
The spell does limit the spirit's demands to a
payment of no more than half the value of the service demanded by the wu jen. The player and DM,
playing each role, must negotiate what the exact
terms of the bargain are. Once the bargain has been
made, the spirit is bound to performing it. The wu
jen can elect to make his payment immediately or
wait until the spirit has fulfilled his portion of the
bargain. Should the wu jen fail to make good on his
part of the bargain, the spirit appeals to the Celestial Bureaucracy for redress. These powerful beings
send a punishment to the wu jen in the form of a—2
penalty on all hit rolls and —2 on all saving throws
until the wu jen fulfills his part of the bargain.
Note that if the spirit makes the saving throw, it
may still remain to deal with the wu jen, although
the terms are never as advantageous as they would
have been under the power of the bargain spell.
The material component for this spell is a bowl
of incense.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; rare elsewhere.

Barrier — Old Empire
(Abjuration)
(Force)
Level: 1
Range: 0.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect 10-ft. radius, 10-ft. high
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to create a transparent magical barrier that protects him from damage.
This barrier is a solid magical wall that circles the
wizard in a 10-foot radius to a height of 10 feet.
This wall can withstand 5 points of damage per
level of the caster, to a maximum of 25 points,
before it shatters. The wizard cannot cast spells that
cause hit points of damage through the barrier, nor
can he physically attack through the barrier.
The barrier has an Armor Class of 5, and automatically suffers full damage from spells. If a
damage-causing spell knocks down the barrier,
the wizard within is entitled to any saving throw
vs. spell to reduce the remaining damage that the
incoming spell allows. The barrier is mobile with
the caster (but awkward in confined spaces).
The material component for this spell is a
piece of jade or amethyst worth 50 gp or more;
this is consumed in the casting.
Notes: Common in Empire; otherwise very
rare. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell,
initial exposure requires a mentor or a read
Southern magic spell.

Barrier Reaver
(Abjuration)
(Force)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds,/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: Cylinder, 1 ft,/level diameter and
length
Saving Throw: None
This spell forces an opening in any magical barrier, including an antimagic shell, a prismatic sphere,
or a conjured physical barrier such as a wall of iron.
The opening comes into being at the endof the
round of casting and lasts for the entire next round.
During this time, spells and other attacks can be
launched through the opening, creatures who can fit
through it can pass the barrier, and what is beyond
the opening can be observed. The caster of the barrier reaver is free to cast another spell during the
round in which the opening exists. This spell does
not destroy the barrier; the opening closes at the end
of the round, inflicting 6d6 points of shearing damage upon any creature caught within it and forcibly
expelling them or their remains on one side of the
barrier (50% chance for either).
The material component of this spell is a small
metal key.
Notes: Uncommon for abjurers; rare for
others. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Basilisk Glare
(Alteration)
Level: 7
Range: 10 ft./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 4 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature/rd,
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes the eyes of the caster to glow
with a bright, ruby-red radiance. Any creature that
the caster looks at and bends her will upon can be
transformed into a stony state for the duration of
the spell plus 143 rounds. A maximumof one being
per round can be so affected. Target creatures must
be at least partially visible to the caster, but need
not meet the caster's gaze to be affected.
The target creature is allowed a saving throw
vs. petrification against the spell. If successful,
the creature is unaffected, and the glare is wasted
for that round.
If the saving throw fails, the creature suffers
1d4 points of physical damage as its body turns
to stone (clothing and items, including magical
items, are also petrified, but are not harmed by a
basilisk glare). The creature also must make a
system shock roll; failure means the creature is
reduced to 2d4 hit points and rendered unconscious (while stone).
Until the magic wears off, the creature is immobile—unseeing, unhearing, and possibly unconscious—and makes saving throws as stone against
ee 74 XNBi asket Trick
all attacks. Beings temporarily petrified by means
of this spell cannot be shattered by physical attacks.
Their actual body state is flickering swiftly and
imperceptibly between stone and flesh, as magical
energy surges pulse and glow.
While employing a basilisk glare, a wizard cannot cast spells or activate any other magic. Activated magical items can be held and continue to
function if their natures allow them to do so, or a
magical weapon in hand could be wielded. Using
basilisk glare does not prevent a caster from participating in physical combat or activities, and the
spell can be ended instantly if the caster desires.
Affected creatures are subject to the spell's effects
for 1d3 rounds after the spell is dropped.
The material components for this spell are a
pebble or stone chip of any type and size and two
teardrops from the caster's eyes.
Notes: Very rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS
Setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Basket Trick
(Alteration) Q ;
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell is somewhat similar to a blink spell, in
that it allows the caster to move randomly about to
avoid damage. However, the spell requires a large
basket or urn, which the caster must climb into
before casting the spell. Once the wizard has
entered the basket and cast the spell, the wizard
instantaneously teleports to another randomly
determined basket or urn within 10 feet per caster
level. Approximately one round later (depending on
the caster's initiative roll), the spell again "blinks"
the caster to another basket within the given range.
This generally gives the caster enough time to peek
out of the basket and decide if it is safe to come out.
The spell can be ended at will by the wizard; otherwise, the wizard blinks once per round until the end
of the spell's duration.
All materials in the basket with the caster at the
time of casting are transported along with the wizard. If the randomly determined basket or urn holds.
other materials that would prevent the caster from
fitting into the container, those materials are magically transported to the caster's previous basket.
Notes: Uncommon in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Battering Ram
(Evocation)
(Force)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: The caster's arm
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell duplicates a ring of the ram's effects.
It wraps the caster's arm in translucent magical
force, making a ram's head at the fist.
+The caster has a Strength score of 19 to open
doors, break items, or hit opponents (2d6 points
of damage); or
+A force can be launched up to 30 feet away in
the direction pointed, in order to hit a target
like a battering ram (ifa door, wall, or other
barrier) or against a creature for 2d6 points of
damage (save vs. spell or be knocked down; a
successful save negates the knockdown but not
the damage).
The material component is a piece of ram's
horn held in the caster's fist.
Notes: Common for the Guild and Watch of
Waterdeep; otherwise uncommon.

Battlecurse
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd. or 4 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables a caster to adversely affect
any one creature not protected by a minor globe
of invulnerability or stronger magical barrier
(some spells and items also may prevent its functioning). A battlecurse can be cast only on being
within range and visible to the caster. The target
is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful,
the only effect is to prevent the creature from
making any attacks on the following round
(defensive spells, movement, readying of weapons, and parrying are all possible). If the saving
throw fails, the creature's Armor Class is worsened by four points (from AC 4 to AC 8, for
example) for four rounds.
The material components of this spell are a
hair (broken or split) from any source, and a gem
of not less than 200 gp value.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from Dracon
Magazine.)

Belsham's Mace
(Evocation)
(Force)
Level: 2
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: Creates 1 mace of force
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a blunt coalescence of force
that bludgeons at a chosen foe from above, with
the caster's THAC0. If this force-weapon hits, it
deals 1d8+2 points of damage and forces the victim to save vs. spell. If the saving throw is failed,
the victim falls unconscious for one round, dropping all held items. Items struck by a Belsham's
mace must save vs. crushing blow. The mace lasts
for only two rounds, whether it hits or not, and
then fades away. It operates even if its creator is
dead, has fled, or is casting another spell—but if
the caster's attention is elsewhere, the mace can
follow, but cannot switch targets.
Notes: Rare or very rare. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Beltyn's Burning Blood
(Necromancy)
(Alchemy)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 3 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, a wizard can cause the
open, bleeding wounds of any creature to burst
te
76 XK\ Bestow Enchantment ge
into flame, converting the blood into a corrosive
mix that inflicts 344 additional points of damage
per round. "Open wounds" is defined as those
wounds created by an edged weapon that have not
been dressed or healed.
Obviously, the creature must have blood in the
first place in order to be affected by this spell.
This excludes undead and extraplanar creatures
that do not have obvious blood (like elementals).
Similarly, creatures that are resistant to fire are
immune to the effects of this spell.
Each of the three rounds the spell is in effect,
the target can make a saving throw vs. spell with
a-3 penalty. If the save is made, no additional
damage is inflicted by the spell.
The caster does not need to touch or even see
the target, as long as the individual meets the
requirements above and is in the range of the
spell. Individuals in the Ethereal Plane are
immune to attacks from the Prime Material, but
not from attackers on their own plane. Creatures
that have changed shape or passed into other
objects (such asa tree or rock) are still vulnerable
to the spell. Creatures and individuals with regenerative abilities or spells can save at the normal
chances to prevent further damage.
The material components of this spell are the
presence of exposed blood and a pinch of saltpeter.
Notes: Uncommon or rare. Known to be in The
Book of Bats.

Bendal's Swoop
(Alteration)
(Air)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
This spell instantly turns any fall by the caster,
accidental or deliberate, into a horizontal swoop.
The horizontal movement of up to 30 feet can
occur at any point in the fall after the caster has
descended at least 10 feet. The horizontal movement can be in any direction the caster desires.
A caster can elect to end the spell at this point
(usually because the horizontal movement has
taken him to a ledge, balcony, or other desired
location), and his landing is then protected as if by
Jfeatherfall. If the spell is not ended at completion
of the horizontal flight, the caster's movement
becomes an involuntary, head-first power dive.
‘A power-diving caster can aim the swooping
descent at a target below, receiving a +4 bonus on
the attack roll. If the attack roll fails, the caster
misses and suffers 5d6 points of impact damage
upon striking any hard surface (less for softer surfaces, for example, 346 points if hitting water).
If the attack roll succeeds, the swooping caster
smashes into the target with magically augmented speed, causing 8d4 points of damage and
forcing a Strength check on the target creature
(save vs. paralysis if no Strength score is given).
If the check fails, the creature is knocked off its
feet and must make a successful saving throw vs.
spell to avoid being stunned (unable to think or
act coherently) for one round. All exposed fragile
items worn or carried by a creature crashed into
must make a successful saving throw vs. crushing
blow or be destroyed.
At the same time, the caster strikes the target,
suffering 2d6 points of impact damage plus any
damage the target can deal with an in-hand
weapon. The diving caster suffers an Armor Class
penalty of 2, and is subject to triple damage if the
target has set a spear or similar piercing pole arm
against the swoop. If not killed in the attack, the
caster rebounds to his feet and can automatically
hit a stunned target creature on the following
round if desired.
Notes: Uncommon or rare in the FORGOTTEN
REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Bestow Enchantment
(Enchantment)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: As spell bestowed + 1
Duration: As spell bestowed
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By casting this simple enchantment, an
enchanter is able to cast on another being a spell
he could normally cast only on himself (that is,
range 0, area of effect "The caster"). For example, the enchanter first casts bestow enchantment on his fighter companion, then follows it
up with an alter self spell. The fighter can
manipulate the alter self spell as if he had cast
the spell himself. The duration of the bestow
enchantment spell ends when the duration of the
bestowed spell ends.
Notes: Restricted to enchanters; rare. (Updated
from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Bewilder
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature/level, 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
A creature affected by this spell loses its sense
of direction and purpose. When the spell takes
effect, the creature immediately forgets its destination or intended action and finds itself lost. The
bewildered creature forgets whatever it was about
to do. This includes attacking an opponent, casting a spell, following a trail or map, or simply
going about daily business.
An affected creature finds itself lost regardless
ofits surroundings. It suddenly feels that it has
never seen the area before, even in places as
familiar as its homeland or even its own living
quarters. It has no idea of its location or how it
arrived there.
A bewildered creature can recognize its own
belongings and comrades, friends, or relatives. It
is not any more susceptible to trickery, or to
spells such as charm, suggestion, hold, or spells
of an illusionary nature.
A bewildered creature in combat loses an
entire round of actions. On the following round,
an Intelligence check is necessary to resume
combat; however, a creature in melee resumes
fighting hostile opponents in self-defense,
although it may not realize who or why it is fighting. The bewildered creature will obey the commands of its comrades if a successful Intelligence
check is made.
‘Abewildered spellcaster forgets the spell he
was about to cast and, if casting, the spell is lost.
Casting is impossible for the duration of the
bewilderment, but once the spell has worn off the
individual can resume casting any remaining
memorized spells.
The material component is the eye of any creature anda bit of wool.
Notes: Uncommon for enchanters; otherwise
rare.

Bigby's Battering Gauntlet
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 ram
Saving Throw: None
This spell brings into existence a shimmering
violet force shaped like a battering ram with a
clenched fist as the ram's head. The force assumes
a cylindrical shape 12 feet long by 2 feet in diameter, but the caster can shorten its length to 3 feet
in order to fit in a cramped space.
The spell acts as a battering ram of great
power, destroying a normal door with one hit,
destroying a reinforced door with three hits,
destroying a stone door with five hits, and having
a 50% chance to destroy a metal door (the spell is
destroyed if the gauntlet fails). Only one attack
can be made per round, as with any ordinary battering ram. Used against a smaller physical
obstruction, such as a dungeon door or metal
grate reinforced with magic, a saving throw is
made for the door at the level of the wizard who
cast the reinforcing spell on the door. If the saving throw is successful, the gauntlet is destroyed.
If the saving throw fails, the gauntlet begins
working on the door.
Against a living target, the ram has no effect.
The caster must always remain within 60 feet of
the ram or it will dissipate. The ram cannot be
damaged by physical attacks, but it can be
destroyed by magical damage equal to half the
number of hit points of the caster. A dispel
magic or disintegrate spell can destroy the
gauntlet, also. The spell cannot be used to open
chests or batter anything but a door. It only functions against portals that are designed to open at
some time.
The material component is a metal rod with a
chain mail gauntlet slipped over one end.
Notes: Uncommon or rare spell (WoG).

Bigby's Besieging Bolt
(Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to magic missile. When the
spell is cast, the wizard is able to fire one magical
siege bolt for every two levels of the caster. The
bolt will behave as a given siege engine missile in
range and effect. The type of siege missile the
bolt mimics depends on the caster's level.
The bolts must be launched at the rate of one
every two rounds in succeeding rounds. During
this time the caster can do nothing else. If the
spell is interrupted, no additional bolts can be
launched. The bolts strike their target unerringly.

Bigby's Bookworm Bane
(Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is used to seek out and destroy one
of the most feared enemies of the wizard: the
bookworm. When cast, the spell creates a disem-
bodied hand that will search through a library and
crush all bookworms it finds. The hand can
search through 100 books or scrolls per round,
seeking out bookworms with a 95% chance of
detection. Once a worm is found, the hand will
pursue the bookworm relentlessly, attacking with
the skill of a fighter equal in level to the caster. A
successful hit by the hand means the bookworm
is instantly crushed to death. The hand possesses
a Strength of 8, so it can move aside books and
scrolls in pursuit of a fleeing bookworm. The
hand cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but it
can be destroyed by 4 or more points of magical
damage. The hand is incapable of performing any
other function or combatting any other foe. Bigby
used the spell periodically to safeguard his valuable library.
The material component is a child-sized glove
made of tough leather.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (WoG).

(Evocation)
Level: 8
Range: 5 yds/level

Casting Time: 8
Duration: 1 rd_/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The Bighy's clenched fist spell brings forth a
huge, disembodied hand that is balled intoa fist.
This magical member is under the mental control
of the spellcaster, who can cause it to strike one
opponent each round, anywhere within the range
of the spell. No concentration is required once the
spell is cast. The clenched fist never misses, but it
can only strike as directed by the caster (which
precludes other attacks by the caster). Thus, it can
be fooled by invisibility or other methods of concealment and misdirection. The effectiveness of
its blows varies from round to round.
D20 Roll Result
112 —— Glancing blow—1d6 hp
13-16 Solid punch—2d6 hp

*The wizard adds +4 to the die rolls of subsequent attacks if the opponent is stunned, as the
opponent is not capable of dodging or defending against the attack effectively.
The fist has an Armor Class of 0, and is
destroyed by damage equal to the hit points of its
caster at full health.
The material component of this spell is a
leather glove and a small device consisting of
four rings joined so as to form a slightly curved
line, with an "I" upon which the bottoms of the
tings rest. The device must be fashioned of an
alloy of copper and zinc.
Notes: Common or uncommon (PHB).

Bigby's Construction Crew
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 12 hrs.
Area of Effect: 180 ft. radius from caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell summons disembodied hands that
will do the work of an entire construction crew.
The caster creates as many pairs of hands as he
has experience levels. All of the hands come
equipped with carpentry tools. The hands do the
work of a construction team equal in ability to
any crew of professional carpenters, masons,
miners, or sappers. The hands never need to rest
oreat, and each pair performs as one worker. The
hands are unable to fight or inflict physical damage on anything. They cannot be destroyed by
nonmagical means, and each pair has as many hit
points as the caster has levels.
The material components of the spell include
an assortment of miniature tools, worth at least
500 gp.

Bigby's Crushing Hand
(Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 5 yds /level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The Bighy's crushing hand spell creates a huge,
disembodied hand similar to those of the other
Bigby's hand spells. The crushing hand is under the
mental control of the caster, and he can cause it to
grasp and squeeze an opponent anywhere within
the spell's range. No attack roll is necessary; the
hand automatically grasps and inflicts constriction
damage in any round in which the wizard concentrates. The damage inflicted depends on the number
of rounds it acts upon the victim.
Ist round 1d10 points
2nd & 3rd rounds 2d10 points
4th & beyond 4d10 points
The crushing hand has an Armor Class of 0, has
as many hit points as its caster at full strength, and
vanishes when destroyed. The hand is susceptible
to normal combat attacks and damaging spells, but
if it is struck by an area-effect spell, the person
held suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if the
hand fails its saving throw, the victim automatically fails his). The hand is not effective against
noncorporeal or gaseous forms, but it does prevent
creatures that are able to slip through small cracks
from escaping, If the hand grasps an item or construction, the appropriate saving throw must be
made as if squeezed by a Strength of25.
The material components of the spell are a
glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg.
Notes: Common or uncommon (PHB).

Saving Throw: None
This spell summons into existence a pair of
disembodied hands that will follow the wizard's
81 Xy's Fantastic Fencers
every order and accompany him wherever he
goes. The hands can perform all the functions of
an unseen servant, but can also accomplish deeds
requiring fine coordination, such as tinkering
with tools, working with laboratory equipment,
sculpting, painting, or playing a musical instrument. The hands can perform any task the caster
can accomplish, including nonweapon proficiencies known by the wizard. The hands will perform with a dexterity equal to that of the caster.
Each hand can hold and carry up to 20 pounds
weight individually, or 50 pounds weight together.

caster's own hands. The hands can move at a rate
of 12, regardless of weight carried, but can move
no farther than 90 feet away from the caster, or
they vanish.

im melee or punch or grapple. They are immune
to physical attacks, but can be destroyed by 6 or
more points of magical damage.

This spell creates one hand for every three levels of the caster, each of which holds a long
sword. Each hand fights with the skill of a fighter
of one-half the experience level of the caster.
Each hand is AC 2 because of its small size and
speed, and each can sustain 15 points of damage
before being dispelled. Each fencer is capable of
disarming an opponent and does so on a roll four
greater than the roll needed to hit. A fencer likewise disarmed of its sword is dispelled automatically. The caster need not concentrate on the
fencers to keep them functioning, but only has to
give them orders as if they were henchmen.
The material component is a small, silver
amulet shaped like a mailed gauntlet holding a
gem-encrusted sword, worth at least 1,000 gp
(this vanishes when the spell is cast).

hand under the caster's command. The hand cannot hold, grasp, or carry, but it does have an
amazingly sensitive sense of touch. The hand'
sense of touch is so fine that it can note minuscule cracks, separations, or openings in a surface,
and thus detect the presence of a secret or concealed door with a 50% chance of success. The
hand can search a 10 foot by 10 foot area each
turn. The hand cannot be destroyed by physical
attacks, but it is dispelled if dealt 4 or more points

formed, it retains its form for the duration of the
spell. The object imitated must be fairly rigid,
can have no moving parts, cannot have a sharp
point or edge, and cannot possess finely
detailed features. A rope, long bow, sword,

bridge, or collection of crossbows could be
formed. As with lesser force sculptures, fine or
accurate details require an additional 2d4 rounds
to form, along with sufficient skill as an artist or
artisan, Up to 1 cubic yard of matter per level of
the caster can be simulated. With the exceptions
noted above, the spell is otherwise identical to the
4th-level spell of the same type.
The material component is a lump of clay
mixed with 1,000 gp of diamond dust, which vanishes when the spell is used.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (WoG).

Bigby's Pugnacious Pugilist
(Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration; 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 pair of hands
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a pair of man-sized hands,
appearing as clenched and padded fists. The
hands pummel with the effectiveness of an 18/50
Strength fighter of one-half the caster's experience level. The hands together fight as an individual with AC 4 and 3 hit points per level of the
wizard. The hands are dispelled when they run
out of hit points. The hands can pummel only, and
cannot hold a weapon or grapple. The hands cannot be grappled or overborne, since they can eas
ily flit away.
The material components are a mitten stuffed
with cotton and a brass bell.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (WoG).

Bigby's Silencing Hand
(Enchantment, Evocation)
Level: 2
Range: 40 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates an appropriately sized hand
that will fly toward the chosen creature and clamp
tightly over the creature's mouth unless the creature makes its saving throw. A creature affected
by the spell will be unable to talk clearly, cannot
cast any spell requiring a verbal component, or
use a magical item triggered by an audible command word. The hand cannot be pulled away
from a creature's mouth or be harmed by a physical attack, but can be destroyed by six or more
points of magical damage, although most magical
attacks carry the risk of harming the affected
creature. A successful dispel magic spell destroys
the hand without injury to the creature.
The material component is a cloth glove
smeared with sticky syrup or honey.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (WoG).

Bigby's Strangling Grip
(Evocation)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a pair of disembodied hands
that will seek out a creature's throat and strangle
the creature much like an attack with a garrote.
The hands must make a successful attack roll to
grab the creature's throat, attacking with +4 to hit
to wizard's THAC0, because of the attack's speed
and ferocity. A miss with the first attack allows an
attack for damage only in the next round.
The strangling grip established in the first
round inflicts 1d4 points of damage, and will
strangle its victim to death by the end of the next
tound unless the creature is freed. The victim can
break the grip with a successful bend bars roll
(creatures vulnerable to this attack, but without
Strength scores, save vs. petrification with a 4
penalty). The grip will be released if the wizard's
concentration is broken.
The hands have no effect against any creature
that the caster could not himself physically strangle with his bare hands; for example, an ochre
jelly, a cow, or any creature above large size (L).
Likewise, such throat protection as a hardened
leather collar or a metal gorget will frustrate the
attack; the spell grants no strength beyond the
caster's own. If the attack is not made by surprise
or from a blind quarter, the hands can be parried
with a ready weapon or limb; a successful parry
blocks the attack.
The material components are a pair of gloves
sewn into a clutching grip around the neck ofa
bottle.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (WoG).

Bigby's Superior Force Sculpture
(Evocation)
Level: 5
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 3 turns + 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Creates 8 cu. ft-/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a more advanced form of the 4thlevel force sculpture spell. The object or objects
formed from force can be more complex, composed of large, moving parts, or have an edge or
point, but still must be fairly rigid. A wagon,
quiver of quarrels, shovel, sword, or water wheel
all could be simulated, but not a mechanical timepiece, crossbow, or spring. Fine details can be
worked into an object, provided the caster has
sufficient skill as an artisan or sculptor. Fine
details take 2d4 rounds to place on an object, but
remain for the duration of the spell. Up to 8 cubic
feet of matter per level of the caster can be simulated. The duration of the spell is also longer than
force sculpture. Superior force sculpture is otherwise identical to the 4th-level spell.
The material component is a lump of clay with
diamond dust mixed into it.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (WoG).

Bind
(Enchantment)
Level: 2
Range: 30 yds
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 50 ft. + 5 ft/level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is employed, the wizard can
command any nonliving ropelike object, including string, yarn, cord, line, rope, or even a cable.
The spell affects 50 feet of normal rope (with a 1
inch diameter), plus 5 feet per caster level. This
length is reduced by 50% for every additional
inch of thickness and increased by 50% for each
half-inch less. The possible commands are Coil
(form a neat, coiled stack), Coil & Knot, Loop,
Loop & Knot, Tie & Knot, and the reverses of all
of the above (Uncoil, etc.). One command can be
given each round.
The rope can only enwrap a creature or an
object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown or hurled near the
intended target. Note that the rope itself, and any
knots tied in it, are not magical. A typical rope
might be AC 6 and take 4 points of slashing damage before breaking. The rope does not inflict
damage of any type, but it can be used as a trip
line or to entangle a single opponent who fails a
saving throw vs. spell.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Bind Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V,S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 undead/level
Saving Throw: Special
The bind undead spell is highly effective
against certain kinds of undead (it has no effect
on living creatures). This spell automatically
affects all chosen corporeal undead of 6* Hit
Dice or less (including common coffer corpses,
crypt things, ghouls, ghasts, great ghuls,
heucuva, mummies, all types of skeletons, sons
of Kyuss, wights, and all manner of zombies),
with no saving throw.
Such creatures curl into a ball (if more than
one undead is affected, they are all gathered into
one tightly packed sphere). Affected undead are
held helpless and immobile, their special abilities
in stasis, until the spell expires or the caster frees
them. The diameter of this ball of undead is typically 2-3 feet per affected creature. Typically, this
"boneball" is conveyed into the midst of foes,
whereupon the caster ends the magic, freeing the
undead to fight.
Against noncorporeal undead (such as ghosts
and spectres) and all undead of7 or more Hit
Dice who don't turn as "Special" (including vampires and liches), bind undead acts only as a slow
spell. These undead are entitled to a saving throw
ys. spell to resist the effect. The bind undead spell
does not effect "Special" undead.
The material component is the bone of any
creature, held in the wizard's left hand at the time
of casting.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Binding
(Enchantment, Evocation)
Level: 8
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: Special
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
A binding spell creates a magical restraint to
hold a creature, usually from another plane of
existence. Extraplanar creatures must be confined by a circular diagram; other creatures can
be physically confined. The duration of the spell
depends upon the form of the binding and the
level of the caster(s), as well as the length of time
the spell is actually uttered. The components vary
according to the formof the spell, but they
include a continuous chanting utterance read
from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and
materials such as miniature chains of special
metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific
herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond
gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of
the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or
carved statuette of the subject to be captured.
Magic resistance applies unless the subject's
true name is used. A saving throw is not applica:
ble as long as the experience level of the casteris
at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the sub
ject. The caster's level can be augmented by
third of the levels of each assisting wizard of:
level or higher, and by one level for each assis
of 4th through 8th level. No more than six ot
wizards can assist with this spell. If the casters,
level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject,
the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The
various forms of binding are:
Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints
that generate an antipathy spell affecting all crea
tures who approach the subject, except the caster
Duration is as long as one year per level of the 1
caster. The subject of this form of binding (as
well as in the slumber and bound slumber ver
sions) remains within the restraining barrier.
Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the
subject for a duration of up to one year per level
of the caster.
Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining
and slumber that lasts for up to one month per
level of the caster.
Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to
or otherwise brought within a confined area from
which it cannot wander by any means until freed.
The spell remains until the magical hedge is
somehow broken.
Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change
to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or
face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject.
Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken
to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within
the hedged prison of some gem or similar object.
The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura
of magic.
The subject of the chaining form of the spell
receives a saving throw with no modifications.
However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus,
bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3
bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus
containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the
subject is magically weakened, the DM can
assign a —1, -2, or even —4 penalty to the saving
throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.
A binding spell can be renewed in the case of
the first three forms of the spell, for the subject
does not have the opportunity to break the bonds.
(If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining
or slumber version, such as attempts to contact
the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving
throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the
subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell
Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is
broken and the creature is free.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Bird Charm I — Pluma
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Range: 100 yds./level
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 wk/level
Area of Effect: 3 birds/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows a caster to summon up to
three small birds for each level of the caster.
These can include birds up to parrot size—
indeed, parrots and hummingbirds are the most
favored targets, as they make no saving throw
against the spell's effects.
Birds summoned via the spell will understand
the rudimentary commands of the caster, and (if a
parrot) will even be able to repeat up to threeword messages.
The material component of the spell is a small,
coral whistle that the caster must carve himself.
The process takes several days, and requires an
unusually large piece of coral
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Bird Charm II —- Pluma
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: 300 yds./level
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 3 birds/level (or more)
Duration: 1 wk./level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is similar to bird charm I, except that
it allows the caster to summon and control all
types of feathered creatures—including the powerful couatl, and other monstrous beings with
plumage, such as owl bears. The spell does not
affect deities, of course.
Enchanted creatures can be given more
involved commands than in the lower level spell;
birds such as parrots and macaws can relay messages of up to 100 words, while creatures under
the thrall of this spell will attack fearlessly if
ordered to do so by the caster.
The material component for this spell is a
whistle carved from a fine piece of jade. Carving
the whistle takes 2-5 weeks.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Black Blade of Disaster — Drow
(Conjuration/Summoning, Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 10 yds /level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 rift blade
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to create a black,
blade-shaped planar rift, about three feet long. It
moves about as the caster wills, providing the
caster can see and concentrate on it, movement
rate of up to 9. If the caster ceases concentration
on the effect at any time, the blade collapses into
nothingness at the end of that round.
The blade can strike twice per round with the
same THAC0 as its caster. A black blade easily
carves through inanimate objects that do not
bear dweomers. A ship loses 1d12% seaworthiness per blow, and structures take damage per
hit equal to that inflicted by a heavy catapult
hit. Walls bolstered by spells are treated as
magical barriers. A black blade of disaster can
cut through prismatic walls and spheres, walls
of force, and all other known magical barriers,
It can penetrate an antimagic shell and affect
objects inside.
Against creatures, a black blade does 2d12
points of damage per strike. If the caster rolls@
natural 20, the blade disintegrates the creature
struck; nothing short of a wish will restore an
individual destroyed in this fashion.
All magical attacks and effects directed at the
rift are absorbed. Anyone trying to seize ot
physically attack the blade is affected as if
struck by the blade. The caster suffers 1d?
points of damage every time he strikes with the
blade, as it draws off some of his lifeforce as
well. This damage does not by itself disrupt his
concentration.
Notes: Restricted to drow; very rare.

Blacklight
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius globe
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell, the wizard createsa
stationary, temporary area of total darkness, The
darkness is impenetrable to normal vision and
infravision, but the caster can see and move nor
mally within the blacklit area. The caster can
attack and cast spells normally within the limits
of his blacklight. Each round, every other creature
in the blacklit area is allowed saving throw vs.
spell at —3. Those who succeed can see as the
wizard does for that round, while those who fail
are wrapped in total darkness, Those outside the
sphere cannot see into it.
Normal and magical lights are doused by the
blacklight. The casting of a light, continual light,
or dispel magic spell to counter this spell destroys,
the blacklit area.
Creatures within the blacklit area have a -4
penalty to attack rolls and saving throws and have
their Armor Class reduced by 4. Those with
blindfighting proficiency are penalized by only
~2 to their attack rolls and saving throws and have
no penalty to Armor Class.
The caster of a blacklight spell can end it at
will, though continuous concentration is not necessary to maintain it. Note that spells that depend
on visual effects (such as illusions) do not function if the victim cannot see them.
The material components of this spell are a
piece of coal and the dried eyeball of any creature.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in Selvar's Inef-
‘fable Conjurations, Magic, and Phantasms.

Blackmantle
(Enchantment, Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
The blackmantle spell creates a shimmering
aura around each creature within the area that
fails a saving throw vs. spell. The aura negates all
healing and regeneration while the spell effect
lasts. For instance, a potion of healing has no
effect on a creature under the influence of a
blackmantle spell, a troll cannot regenerate lost
hit points, and cure light wounds spell or staff of
curing is useless.
If the saving throw is failed, the creature is
affected for 1 turn per level of the caster. If the
creature is still alive at the end of the spell's duration, any active curative forces will operate normally; for instance, a ring of regeneration
resumes its function. Healing magic applied after
the spell wears off works normally.
The material component for this spell is a small
mummified animal, such as a mouse or a toad.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.

Blacksphere
(Abjuration, Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds. +2 yds/level
Components: V, 8, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 2d4 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius globe
Saving Throw: Special
Created by a long-since forgotten wizard
(though some in Waterdeep insist it was once
known as Hilather's blacksphere), the blacksphere spell is a core spell to the development of
the rare magical beads of force and their effects
are nearly identical.
When cast, a black force burst erupts at the
caster's desired focal point, causing 1d4 points of
damage, plus 1 point per caster level, to all creatures
within a 10-foot radius. Creatures failing a saving
throw vs. spell are trapped in a 10-foot radius sphere
of force for the duration of the spell; victims cannot
escape the sphere by any means less than those used
to destroy a wall of force. A successful saving throw
blows the creature out of the encapsulated area,
though it still takes damage from the force burst.
The material components are a small piece of
charcoal and a small piece of onyx.
Notes: Very rare.

Blackstaff
(Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V,
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 staff
Saving Throw: Special
This is a close copy of the famous spell created
by the archmage Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun of
Waterdeep, supposedly leaked by a disgruntled
apprentice. The magic causes any nonmagical
staff, club, piece of wood, or pole arm held by the
caster to shimmer with a black, crawling radiance.
Ablackstaff weapon has the special properties.
+ It cannot harm the caster or any other beings
touching the staff during the casting of the spell.
+ It strikes as a +4 magical weapon to hit (no
damage bonus).
+ It inflicts 1d8 points of damage, regardless of
the weapon's size and shape.
+ It absorbs magic cast upon it, without consequence,
and is apparently unaffected by any magic except a
wish or antimagic shell, which can negate it.
In addition, the wielder can choose one of several abilities at the beginning of each round to use
as a special attack.
* Touch drains 1 hit point automatically (the target
gets a saving throw vs. death magic to avoid losing the point permanently—failure means the hit
point is unrecoverable except by use of a wish),
* Touch acts as a dispel magic spell (at 8th level)
on all magical barriers, weapons, or effects;
failure means the staff can't succeed against the
effect at 8th level; the caster can choose to use
his own level, but this dispels the blackstaff
regardless of the outcome.
* Touch may cause mental damage (random roll),
as follows:
Roll Effect
01-45 Target unaffected
46-65 Target confused (as the 4th-level wizard spell) for 1d4 rounds
66-75 Target stunned (as the 9th-level wizard symbol spell) for 1d3 rounds
76-85 Target affected by fear (as the 4thlevel wizard spell) for 1d2 rounds
86-95 Target affected by repulsion (as the
6th-level wizard spell) for 1 round
96-00 Target affected by feeblemind (as the
Sth-level wizard spell) for 1 turn
* Touch causes any spellcaster to save vs. paralyzation or either forget one memorized spell or
be unable to use one natural spell-like power for
two rounds (if a choice exists, determine the
spell or ability at random).
* Touch causes a being possessing psionic skills
or wild talents to be psionically "scrambled"
(unable to use any powers except defenses) for
1d4 rounds.
Ablackstaff also can be wielded by any creature able to use a polearm that can withstand (or
is immune to) its effects. A blackstaff prevents
spellcasting by any being who is in contact with it
during a given round. It can be used, therefore, to
ruin enemy spellcasting with a successful attack.
(It cannot be thrown easily and resists telekinesis
and similar movements as it does almost all other
magic.) At the spell's expiration, the material
component (the staff) is instantly and completely
consumed.
Notes: Restricted to those trained by Khelben
or certain senior harpers. One apprentice is
known to have stolen and spread the spell; also
known to be in Laeral's Libram.

Blacksteel
(Alteration)
(Shadow)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Maximum 2 turns/level
Area of Effect: 1 weapon
Saving Throw: None
This spell makes a weapon more suitable for
stealth and dark deeds. Although blacksteel
works on any sort of weapon, it is usually
employed on bladed metal weapons. It enables
the caster to temporarily alter the properties of
any one touched weapon.
The weapon becomes dark, silent, and nonreflective. A blacksteel weapon does not make any
noises as a result of striking beings or objects,
even it is if broken by the severity of its use. Also,
any blood shed by it adheres to it, neither spraying from it nor dripping down it, as long as the
spell lasts.
The weapon can be magical or have other
enchantments laid on it before the blacksteel
spell is cast. The spell does not affect the conductivity of the weapon. Though it makes the
weapon magical for purposes of attack, it does
not confer upon the blade any bonuses to attack
or damage.
A blacksteel spell ends if the weapon it is cast
upon comes into physical contact with any new
magic after the spell is established, even if the
magic is not aimed at or does not affect the
weapon wielder. Typical cases include:
* Touching an enchanted or magical object: striking a magical shield or armor, being parried
with a magical weapon (even a normal blade
enchanted with Nystul's magic aura), triggering
a magical trap.
*Striking an inherently magical creature or one
protected by a defensive spell: a golem, a djinni,
a gargoyle, stoneskin, armor, minor globe of
invulnerability.
* Being exposed to a magical effect that would
affect the blade: an identify spell is cast upon
the blade, the blade is exposed to a dispel
magic, etc.
* The blade is carried while the wielder is affected
bya magical spell that may not affect the blade:
charm, hold, paralyzation, protection from evil,
invisibility, etc.
The blacksteel spell is not ended by:
* Being brought into an area affected by a previously-cast spell: continual light or darkness, etc.
+The wielder casts a spell or uses a magical
device against someone else.
* Magics affecting the caster before the blacksteel
spell is cast will not end the spell.
* Contact with a magical scabbard of any sort will
not end the spell.
There is one special exception: Ifa locate
object is cast on a blacksteel weapon, or used to
seek that weapon, the spells cancel each other;
both end and the weapon is not located.
The material components of this spell are a
pinch of iron filings and a scrap of cobweb.
Notes: Rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting;
virtually unknown elsewhere.

Blackthorns
(Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 6 rds.
Area of Effect: 10-ft. diameter
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes a thick circle of thorny
hedge, 10 feet in diameter, to rise up around the
caster. The hedge is as high as the caster's chest,
is open at the top, and is immovably fixed in
place. It can be hacked apart, but does not burn
(although magical fire will inflict damage on it)
and its position cannot be shifted by physical or
magical attacks.
Within the ring of thorns, the caster's Armor
Class is improved by 2 against all physical
attacks. This Armor Class bonus applies even if
the ring has been breached and attacks come
through the opening. The caster can pass repeatedly and freely through the hedge as if it does not
exist, taking no damage.
The unnaturally thick hedge prevents mansized or smaller creatures from pushing their
way through. Larger creatures pushing through
the hedge move athalf speed. All creatures trying to force their way through the hedge take
1d8 points of damage per round. Charging into
the hedge or contacting it forcefully inflicts
double damage.
The hedge can be chopped through safely with
edged weapons. The hedge can be hit automatically; 20 points damage will create a one-manwide breach to the center, while 40 points will
create a one-man-wide breach all the way through
the thorns.
No means is known to make this spell last
longer. The various spells that extend the duration
and effects of most existing magic fail to work on
a blackthorn hedge.
The material components of this spell are three
thorns or whittled wooden or bone spikes of thorn
shape.
Notes: Rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting;
virtually unknown elsewhere.

Blade in the Soul
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 9
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 individual
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables the caster to compel a being
to do something specific or be harmed. The target
must be a specific individual known by sight or
name to the caster, but need not be visible to the
caster at the time of casting.
The caster holds aloft a bladed metal weapon
7 91 XKAp Blade of Disaster (
of any sort (a dagger is most often used, as the
weapon is consumed by the magic) and says the
incantation. The target feels a chill in its vitals
(in humans, typically in the heart) and hears the
caster's voice in its mind, whispering the deed
that must be done. The deed can be as intricate,
involved, and specific as the caster desires,
including having multiple steps. For example,
the course of action might be: "Go immediately
to the north tower and release the third pigeon
from the left from its cage, and then put your
wandof shooting stars in its beak and let if fly
away without harming it in any way or placing
any spell upon it. Do not try to trace where it
goes by any means. After the bird has flown, go
to your throne room, announce to whomever is
there that you are renouncing the throne, break
your crown with your mace, and put the pieces
on the seat of the throne. Then spit in the court
wizard's face, take off your robes, walk out of
the castle, and dive into the moat, singing the
following song. . ."
The subject being is given an immediate
choice: Follow the caster's commandment or die.
In the case of NPCs and monsters, the DM must
decide which course is followed given alignment,
temperament, and situation.
Ifthe target being accepts the task and becomes
a "bladed one," the spell empowers the caster to
observe the target from afar whenever desired
until the deed is done. A round of mental concentration is necessary to establish contact. The
caster can then see and hear all the target creature
can for as long as the caster concentrates on
doing so. When the deed is done, the spell ends,
and the caster has no further control over the
actions of the bladed one.
At any one time before the deed is completely
fulfilled, the caster can by silent act of will teleport without error into the presence of the bladed
one without casting that spell. (This transportation is fueled by the original spell.)
If the target being refuses the task and fights
the spell, an immediate saving throw vs. spell
must be made. If it succeeds, the target suffers
1d2 points of damage per level of the caster and
must make a system shock roll. Failing the saving
throw results in instantaneous death.
If the target creature dies from the damage,
system shock, or as a result of trying to carry out
the task, the target rises as a zombie after a day
has passed (even if blasted to dust), and begins to
travel toward the caster. Although this lumbering
undead creature may frighten beings who see it,
its foremost purpose is to get to the caster. It
avoids combat wherever possible.
When it reaches the caster, it touches the
caster. After contact is made, it becomes an
absolutely loyal zombie under the caster's control. If the zombie is destroyed before or after
reaching the caster, it remains destroyed and
does not rise again. The person on whom the
spell was cast can then be resurrected or raised
normally.
Certain of the sisters (notably Laeral, who once
had this spell used on her) refuse to use this spell,
but the Simbul is almost never to be encountered
without it.
Notes: Very rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS
setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Blade of Doom
(Evocation)

Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 year maximum
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None/Neg.
Blade of doom, recorded elsewhere as
Shaeroon's scimitar, is a specialized type of 1
curse. When cast, a large blade of magical force
appears above the target creature. This blade is
visible only to the caster, those who can see invisible items, and those who cast a detect magic
spell on the creature. The blade is poised to drop
on the creature's head when a particular action
(specified by the caster) occurs, such as the
speaking of a particular word, beginning to casta
spell, or drawing a weapon.
If the condition is met, the blade immediately
drops upon the creature (and the creature only)
inflicting 1 point of damage per level of the
caster. A successful saving throw vs. spell negates
this damage.
The caster of the spell can dispel it at will, as
can such magic as a limited wish or wish. A simple dispel magic has no effect on the blade of
doom. Only one blade of doom can be cast ona 1
particular individual at a time.
Blade of doom is a very long-lasting spell.
Unless dispelled by the caster it can last up toa
year before its energies run out. It is usually used
as a method of vouchsafing an individual's good
conduct in negotiations and occasionally asa
form of punishment to those who offend a wizard

or are seeking his favors.
The material component of this spell is a small
scimitar carved of rock crystal (value 300 gp),
diamond, or clear sapphire (value 3,000 gp).
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in The
Book of Bats and Tidings of Conflict and Woe.

Bladeleap
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: 1 bladed weapon
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to make any bladed
‘weapon fly from his hand to strike at a chosen being.
The weapon need not be one in which the caster is
proficient, and it strikes only once, with a magical
bonus of +4 on both attack and damage rolls.
The weapon is not consumed in the casting,
but does not return to the caster. It falls to the
ground after a single attack. If the caster tries to
send it beyond 10 feet per experience level, the
weapon falls to the ground at that distance and
the spell is wasted.
The material components of this spell are a
hair from the caster or a thread from the caster's
garments.
Notes: Uncommon in the FORGOTTEN REALMS
setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Bladethirst
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: 1 bladed weapon
Saving Throw: None
For the round following the casting of this
spell, any single-edged, slashing weapon is
granted a +3 bonus to hit (but not to damage).
The blade ignites with a fiery blue-white glow
visible to all, which fades once the weapon has
struck an opponent or at the end of the next
round, whichever comes first. This bonus is in
addition to any Strength bonus or inherent magical bonus of the item. A sword +/ provided with
this spell will strike with a +4 bonus the next
round, then return to being a +1 blade.
The material component of bladethirst is a drop
of blood and a pinch of powdered silver. Only one
bladethirst spell can be placed on an item at one
time. This spell cannot be made permanent.
Notes: Uncommon. Known to be in Sabirine's
Specular.

Blandness
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 pint or pound of material
Saving Throw: None
This spell can be cast only on nonliving material. Its effect is to render the material completely
tasteless and odorless. Color, texture, and so on
are not affected. Thus, a poisonous substance
could be inserted in food, and could be detected
only by suspicious color, texture, or consistency,
or by the use of a spell such as detect poison. The
spell itself, when used on foodstuffs, is detectable
only by means of a detect magic.
The material component of this spell is a dram
of distilled water.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in the Cyclopedia Phantastica, Vol. II. (Updated from Dracon
Magazine.)

Blast Jewel — Dragon
(Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Until triggered
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, a dragon traces an
invisible glyph on a prized gemstone worth at
least 500 gp. The gemstone must be an individual, loose stone; it cannot be set into a piece of
jewelry or embedded into a weapon. The symbol
can be seen only by the dragon who traced it,
though a detect magic will find a faint aura, while
detect invisibility, true seeing, or similar magics
reveal the glyph. A successful dispel magic
negates the glyph before its effects can be activated without harming the jewel itself. Otherwise, the spell remains dormant until the dragon
decides to activate it.
At the mental command of the dragon, the
gemstone explodes with great force, showering a
20-foot radius area with a hail of shrapnel. The
dragon can trigger the explosion from any distance, even if thousands of miles separate the
dragon and the gem. If the jewel and the dragon
are separated by a planar boundary or the dragon
is slain, then the spell is immediately negated.
All creatures within the area suffer 5d4 points
of damage, half that if a saving throw vs. breath
weapon succeeds. Any creature holding or carrying the jewel when the explosion occurs receives
no saving throw.
If, however, the gem was carried in a chest,
metal box, or a similar rigid and sturdy container, then the explosion is contained and no
damage is inflicted on any creature, though
objects inside the container (and the container
itself) must save vs. crushing blow or be
destroyed. The explosion of magical force is
sufficient to shred pouches, sacks, backpacks,
saddlebags, and so forth, even if such items are
made of leather or other durable fabric. Items
such as portable holes and bags of holding
receive a saving throw vs. disintegration to survive; if they do not, then any surviving contents
are lost in an extradimensional plane.
Dragons use this spell as the proverbial "last
laugh" against thieves. When the dragon notices
that one of its blast jewels is missing, it simply
activates the magic, thus destroying the gem and
sending a message to the creature that had the
audacity to take it.
The material component is the jewel itself,
which is completely destroyed in the explosion;
nothing but dust remains.
Notes: Restricted to dragons; rare.

Blastbones
(Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 40 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time:
Duration: Until triggered
Area of Effect: Bones, 1 cu. ft. to 3 cu. ft.
Saving Throw: Special
This spell allows the caster to shatter exposed
bones in a violent explosion. The bones can be
part of a simple undead skeleton or partial zombie, or inanimate skeletal remains, which can be
any number of small, disconnected pieces. The
bones of creatures with more than 4 Hit Diceor
levels are immune to this spell.
The spell can be cast to take effect immediately, or set to be triggered at any later time, at
conditions governed by a verbal summary identical to that used in a magic mouth spell.
If acting immediately, the spell causes a skeleton, pile of bones, or the like to explode ina blast
that affects a 10—foot radius spherical blast area.
Those in the area are allowed a saving throw vs.
spells for half damage; if it fails, they take 2d4
points of damage from bone shards. If the skeleton is undead, it is destroyed in the explosion.
Undead normally receive a saving throw
against a blastbones spell; if the save is success
ful, the spell creates only a small explosive puff
inflicting 1d4+1 points ofdamage. If a delayed
blastbones spell is cast on remains before they
are animated as undead, no saving throws by the
undead are allowed; the animation does not
impair the future operation of the spell.
If set as a trap, the blastbones damage can be
augmented by other material placed to serve as
shrapnel. One common use for this spell involves
a partial zombie, set as a guardian. When itis
attacked for a total of 6 points or more of damA
94age, it explodes in shards of rotting flesh, bones,
and nails (placed inside it before animation). Any
creature within 15 feet is hit by 1d12 nails; each
nail does 1 hit point damage, and those within 10
feet take 2d4 points of damage from the bone
shards as well. Those from 16 to 20 feet distant
must make two successful saving throws vs. paralyzation to escape damage; if one check succeeds, only 1d3 nails strike; if both checks fail,
1d6 nails strike.
The material components for this spell are a
drop of water, a fleck of dust, a pinch of ash, and
the bones to be affected.
Notes: Uncommon for necromancers; otherwise
very rare. (Updated from DrsGon Magazine.)

Blastcloak — Phaerimm
(Abjuration)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a more powerful version of the
backblast spell; it hurls back spells involving
flames or fiery explosions cast at the protected
creature (and these only; not heat alone, nor lightning-like electrical energy discharges). Firebased magic (including magical item effects and
even the most powerful spells, such as meteor
swarm) are cast automatically back at the source,
or the protected being can specifically direct
them elsewhere.
A blastcloak protects a single creature—usually the caster, but may be another touched during
spelleasting. Once casting is complete, the protection cannot be transferred.
Once cast, this spell forms an invisible aura
around the protected being, operating without
any concentration and without disturbing subsequent spellcasting by the protected being.
When a spell attack involving fire strikes the
protected being, the blastcloak functions automatically. It prevents the disruption of spellcasting or other activity and protects all flammable
items on the being from harm; they need not
make saving throws. A blastcloak is effective
against multiple fiery attacks during the same
round.A blastcloak will send back a spell (a
delayed blast fireball, for instance) over vast distances to a source that has left the scene—but
cannot follow a source onto another plane. In
such cases, the attacking magic is merely negated.
The spell continues until it expires, is successfully dispelled, or the creature dies or goes to
another plane.
A protected creature not preoccupied with
spellcasting or other complex activity during a
round can redirect a fiery attack to any spot the
creature can see (for example, against other foes).
The DM judges whether an attack roll is required
to hit the new target; the effects and damage of
the attack are unaltered.
Incoming fiery attacks cause the wearer of a
blastcloak to feel a tingling, surging sensation;
they can redirect this at a target they are looking
at without ever seeing the source of the attack, or
precisely what spell or item caused it.
Notes: Restricted to Phacrimm; common.

Blending
(Alteration, [llusion/Phantasm)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell confers abilities much like a robe of
blending. It works only on creatures of man-size
or smaller. It enables the creature to appear to be
part of whatever background, scenery, or terrain it
happens to be standing in. It may appear to be
part of a rock wall, a plant, a piece of furniture, or
even a creature of another sort such as an orc
among a crowd of orcs—whatever is appropriate.
The proper coloration, form, and even odor are
produced by the spell, although blending will not
change the creature to be more than twice its normal height or less than half. It does not provide
language or sound-mimicking capabilities. An
individual in a situation where several different
forms might be appropriate must state which
form is desired. The creature can change its
appearance at will while the spell is in effect;
each change requires half a round of concentration. All those acquainted with and friendly to the
creature see it normally.
In most situations, the creature need not fear
detection unless attacking or taking some other
highly visible or inappropriate action. However,
when within 30 feet of those of exceptional Intelli-
95 XBlessing of the Gypsies
gence or many Hit Dice, the latter have a chance to
spot something unusual about the blended creature.
The check is made initially and for each turn thereafter that the blended creature remains within 30
feet. This assumes that the nonblended creatures
are reasonably alert or that the blended creature has
done something slightly out of the ordinary.
A creature with exceptional Intelligence has a
1% chance per point of Intelligence to notice
something unusual. A creature with 10 or more
Hit Dice or levels has a 1% chance per Hit Die or
level. The chances are cumulative: a 12th-level
wizard with an 18 Intelligence has a 30% chance
to notice something unusual.
The material component is a piece of dried
chameleon skin.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from POLYHEDRON
Newszine.)

Blindness
(Iusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: 30 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The blindness spell causes the victim to become
blind, able to see only a grayness before its eyes.
Various cure spells will not remove this effect, and
only a dispel magic or the spellcaster can do away
with the blindness if the creature fails its initial
saving throw vs. spell. A blinded creature suffers a
—4 penalty to its attack rolls, and its opponents
gain a +4 bonus to their attack rolls.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Blink
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard causes his
material form to "blink" directly from one point
to another at a random time and in a random
direction. This means that melee attacks against
the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked. Spellcastingis
not possible while blinking.
Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard
rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink—
the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard's
initiative for that round. The wizard disappears
and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant
from his previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2=
right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left
behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The
caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such
is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable
objects of size and mass comparable to the
caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks
in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed,
solid object, the caster is then trapped on the
Ethereal Plane.
During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who
win initiative or by those who are able to strike
both locations at once (for example, with a breath
weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack
forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those
operating under Aaste or similar effects, can often
strike early enough to have at least one attack
against the caster.
If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any)
until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink
is added to his normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus,
he probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get his attack in before he
blinks (he must announce his intent before
rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for
initiative). In this case, the caster compares the
two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is
lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not
added if he is trying to attack before he blinks).
If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll,
then blinks according to the blink roll. If his
blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks first and then attacks in whatever
direction he's facing (he must go through with 1
his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong.
direction to affect anyone).
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Block Advancement
(Abjuration, Charm)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
1 Casting Time: 1 turn
1 Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
1 Saving Throw: Neg.
When a block advancement spell is success-
1 fully cast upon a wizard, it instantly strips him of
1 the ability to advance in levels of spellcasting
ability until the wizard successfully survives the
ordeal induced by a conquer self spell. The spell
affects only a single wizard of no less than Sth
level, and no greater than 15th level, of an alignment identical to the caster. The block advancement spell cannot be removed otherwise except
by the use of a wish.
The recipient is allowed a saving throw vs.
spell (which can be forfeited by a willing subject), Because the spell was designed to stop the
advancement of any wizard deemed unworthy of
power until such time as he has proved himself
worthy, the original researcher of the spell (most
likely a member of the Black Circle) assumed
that the recipient would be willing to recerve the
spell (the alternative was death). If the spell is
applied to an unwilling subject who makes a successful saving throw, the subject suffers damage
equal to 1d12 hit points, plus 1 per level of the
caster, but is otherwise unaffected.
Once the block comes into effect, the recipient
cannot learn any new spells (though new spells
can be recorded in a spellbook) nor can the recipient cast any spells of a level above the highest
level available before being blocked. More spells
ofthe levels currently castable can be gained
Thus, a blocked Sth-level wizard couldn't cast
fourth-level spells until the block was removed,
but could gain additional third-level spells.
A block advancement spell does not prevent a
wizard from gaining experience points while it
remains in effect, nor does it prohibit the wizard
from gaining new weapon and nonweapon proficiencies and additional hit points when enough
1 experience is gained to advance in level. The only
effect of the spell is to limit the wizard to his current level of spellcasting ability, Once the block is
1 removed, the recipient immediately gains the normal spellcasting abilities appropriate to his level.
The casting requires a small jade statue of the
affected wizard, upon which a feeblemind spell
has been cast prior to the casting of the block
advancement spell. The statue can be used only
once, as it shatters when the block is removed.
Prematurely shattering the statue shatters the
spell and forces the recipient to make an immediate system shock check or die. Further, the block
becomes irrevocable until a new statue is fashioned, after which either a wish or conquer self
ordeal becomes possible.
Notes: Common for wizards of the Black Circle:
otherwise very rare. Known to be in the Book of
Black Circles. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Blood Drain (Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
This devastating spell allows a wizard to drain
bloodline points from a victim and transfer them
to his own bloodline. The victim of this spell forfeits 2d8 points of bloodline strength, and these
points are permanently transferred to the caster.
A wizard can cast this spell on a victim more than
once, but cannot reduce a victim to less than 1
bloodline point.
In addition the caster has a chance to drain a
blood ability from his victim. For every point of
bloodline strength drained, there is a 1% cumulative chance that the caster drains a blood ability.
If this change occurs, the DM chooses a blood
ability to be lost, beginning with the lowest-level
blood abilities. For example, if an individual with
two minor and one major blood abilities becomes
the victim of this spell, one random minor ability
will be lost.
If the caster is eligible for the blood ability
(that is, it is not restricted by his derivation and he
does not already possess it), he gains the ability.
Otherwise, the blood ability is lost.
The target is allowed a saving throw, which
receives a 1-point bonus for each blood ability he
possesses and is modified according to bloodline
strength (tainted, -2; minor, —0,; major, +2; great,
+4), Thus, an individual with a great bloodline
and two major blood abilities adds a bonus of +6
(4+1+1) to his saving throw.
If the victim succeeds in his saving throw, he
suffers no effect of the spell. If he succeeds by
more than 10 points. the spell backfires, forcing
the caster to make a saving throw with the same
modifiers. If the caster fails, he permanently
loses 1d8 points of bloodline strength (his victim
does not gain these points). The caster loses a
blood ability only if he now has too many blood
abilities for his reduced bloodline strength (see
Chapter 12 in the BIRTHRIGHT Rulebook).
In all cases, lost bloodline strength points and
abilities can be restored through normal means:
gaining points through Realm Point expenditures,
slaying blooded individuals with a tighmaevril
weapon or directly through the heart, or earning
bloodline points to roll on Table 12.
Note: A victim may voluntarily submit to this
spell by forgoing the saving throw. In this case the
spell succeeds automatically.
The reverse of this spell, blood restoration,
allows the caster to return bloodline points stolen
through blood drain to their original owner. The
spell must be cast within one week of absorbing
the stolen bloodline points. The caster cannot
"carry" bloodline points from more than one
individual during this time (if the wizard casts
this spell on more than one individual within one
week's time, the bloodlinge points are irreversibly
mingled with the caster's). The wizard can cast
blood restoration on the same individual more
than once. If blood restoration is not cast within
the allotted time, the caster permanently retains
the bloodline points.
Before the original owner can get his points
back, he must first pass a system shock roll,
When bloodline points are returned to their original owner, the individual does not gain new blood
abilities. If the individual lost a blood ability initially, he can roll a saving throw with the modi
fiers described above. If he fails the saving throw,
he gains one random blood ability of the same
level that he lost (reroll for abilities inaccessible
to the individual). If he passes the saving throw,
he does not regain a blood ability.
Notes: Common in Cerilia (the BIRTHRIGHT
setting) virtually unknown elsewhere.

Blood Lightning
(Alteration, Evocation, Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Until triggered
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
This spell can be cast on the caster or on any
creature touched. The blood lightning spell doesn't take effect until the creature next bleeds, and
is virtually undetectable until activated. The only
way to prevent the blood lightning from taking
effect once cast is by the casting of a remove
curse on the recipient.
Within a turn after the creature first bleeds,it
can by silent act of will lash out, releasing the
blood lightning. If it does not, the magic heals the
creature of 1d4+1 points of damage and dissipates. (If the creature is a spellcaster, releasing
the blood lightning does not count as castinga
memorized spell; it can be released in additionto
normal casting in the round.)
The spell manifests as a web of leaping and
crackling blood-red lightning, raging out from
any wounds the creature has, to cause all beings
within 40 feet 6d6 points of damage, save vs.
spell for half damage. A being unleashing blood
lightning is never harmed by it and, furthermore,
can prevent a being within range of the lightning
from taking damageif able to directly touch the
being as the lightning is released.
If not activated, the magic dissipates after 24
hours. Multiple castingsof this spell on an individual are not cumulative.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, and select Harpers; uncommon.

Bloodbridge
(Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
Casting this spell allows the movement of
blood from a donor, through the caster, into a
recipient. The transfused blood heals some of the
recipient's wounds, at the expense of the donor.
For each hit point restored to the recipient, the
donor loses a point.
The amount of damage that can be healed is
limited to 2 hit points, plus 1 hit point per level of
the caster, This is the daily maximum per recipient. Although multiple donors can be used (each
requiring a separate casting), the sum total of
healing cannot exceed the maximum. In addition,
this spell can heal only damage caused by blood
loss, such as: weapon-inflicted wounds, claw and
bite attacks, blood drain, and so on (not electrical
shock, pummeling, poison, suffocation, pure
magical energy, and the like).
The donor can be anyone of the same species
as the recipient (a half-elf counts as both human
and elf). The caster can serve as the donor if
desired. Regardless of who the donor is, the
transfusion process is extremely taxing for the
caster, who temporarily loses 1 point of Strength
per 5 points of blood transferred, and 1 point of
Constitution each time the spell is cast. These
return at the rate of 1 per four hours of complete rest or eight hours of light activity (no
spellcasting).
Extracting blood from an unwilling donor is an
evil act, and an unwilling donor must be immobilized for the entire round required to cast the
spell; it cannot be cast on an unwilling donor in
melee, for example.
The material components of this spell are two
golden needles (1 gp value each), which are
destroyed in the casting.
Notes: Rare for necromancers and (optional)
Healer mages; otherwise very rare. (Updated
from DRAGON Magazine.)

Bloodglass
(Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, 8, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds. + 1 rd_/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw. Neg.
This spell allows a wizard to roughly gauge the
vital force remaining in any one living creature
(including himself) within the spell's range. The
chosen creature, even if it is weakened, spellbound, or otherwise unaware that a spell is being
cast on it, receives a saving throw vs. spell at a—3
penalty.
Tf successfully cast, the intangible image of an
hourglass appears, floating in the air near the
caster's head. It seems to contain blood that drips
from the upper compartment (the "healthy
being") into the lower compartment ("blood
spilled"). The dripping liquid is luminous—about
equal to faerie fire—and can be seen clearly up to
50 feet away, even in darkness. The hourglass
image is visible to all creatures, can be moved
about as the caster desires, and need not be concentrated on to remain in existence (that is, the
caster can perform other spellcasting without
causing the image to disappear). The image does
not automatically accompany the caster; it moves
only in accordance with the caster's conscious
will. If the image and caster are ever farther apart
than the spell range, the image disappears, ending
the spell.
This spell does not measure the precise hit
points remaining to a creature, but rather the
proportion of total vitality remaining (for
example, if the creature has only one-quarter of
its hit points remaining, the upper part of the
hourglass image is a quarter full). Damage
taken by the creature shows up in the glass as
trickling or streaming blood, individual hit
points can't be counted.
The material component is a small hourglass;
this is thrown into the air as the incantation is
murmured, and is consumed (amid twinkling
motes of light) as the incantation is completed.
Notes: Uncommon for diviners; otherwise
‘very rare. (Updated from Dricon Magazine.)

Bloodline Corruption
(Alteration)
Level: 9
Range: 50 fi.
Components: V, $, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 60 hrs.
Area of Effect: 2 creatures
Saving Throw: None
This spell changes the bloodline of a creature
from its original source to that of Azrai, forcing
the subject to become an awnshegh. Bloodline
corruption forms a link between the caster (or
another "donor" creature) and the recipient. For
every three points of bloodline strength in the
recipient, the spell drains one point of bloodline
strength from the caster (or donor). The recipient
maintains his current bloodline strength and abilities, but his blood becomes the blood of Azrai
and he gains the curse of bloodform and 1d4 abilities available to Azrai bloodlines.
Notes: The Manticore is the only known recipient of this spell, and the Magian is the only wizard
with knowledge of this spell m Cerila. The Magian
has created four scrolls with this spell to be "stolen"
and scattered about Cerilia to foment future chaos.

Bloodstars
(Alteration)
(Force)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 rd./levels
Area of Effect: 90-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates seven star-shaped, spiked
fields of whirling, sparkling force from seven
drops of the caster's blood. These bloodstars
move about in response to the caster's will (MV
F121, MC: A). All seven can attack separate tar
gets, although they dissipate if they move more
than 90 feet away from the caster. The caster is
limited to half movement and no other actions
while directing the bloodstars.
A bloodstar strikes any target at THAC06
(adjust for defensive Dexterity and any "pluses"
of magical protection the target creature has). The
razor-sharp points of force of the bloodstar slash
through normal armor and nonmagical barriers to
inflict 1d4 points of damage. Due to the energy
aura exuded by astriking bloodstar, only one of
them can strike the same creature in one round,
Once a particular bloodstar has drawn blood,
the caster can make it explode on any subsequent
round, inflicting 2d6 points of damage upon all
creatures within 10 feet; save vs spell for half
damage. At the conclusion of the spell, all unexploded bloodstars wink out of existence.
The material components are the seven drops of
the caster's blood that transform into the bloodstars
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from Dracov
Magazine.)

Bloodstone's Frightful Joining
(Necromancy)
Level: 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Undead creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
When this powerful spell is employed, the wizard transfers his lifeforce to the body of an
undead creature, totally dommating it. This spell
can be very useful when combined with the 4thlevel mask of death spell.
N\ Bloom
An intelligent undead creature is allowed a
saving throw vs. spell to resist the joining. If successful, the caster's lifeforce is forced back into
his own body and the wizard must make a system
shock roll. If the system shock roll fails, the wizard suffers 5d6 points of damage; if successful,
the wizard suffers half this.
Ifthe undead creature fails the saving throw,
the wizard takes over the undead creature. While
in the creature's body, the caster can use all of its
special attacks and innate abilities, excluding any
ofits memorized spells. The wizard's lifeforce
can travel an unlimited distance from his physical
body as long as they remain on the same plane of
existence. The wizard's body meanwhile remains
comatose, is subject to all regular attacks, suffering any damage normally.
An intelligent undead continually tries to
purge the caster with mental threats that can be
heard only by the wizard. The thoughts of the
undead are ghastly. During the first round of
tach hour of control, the caster must succeed an
Intelligence check in order to remain sane. The
toll is modified by the difference between the
undead creature's Intelligence and that of the
wizard. If the undead has a higher score, the difference is added to the roll. If the wizard's Intel-
1 ligence is higher, the difference is subtracted
from the roll.
If the roll is successful, nothing happens. If
the Intelligence roll fails, the wizard's intellect
degenerates, making him a raving, homicidal
maniac. His lifeforce is immediately forced to
return to his body, and he must make a system
shock roll or take 5d6 damage (half if successful). The caster remains dangerously insane
until a heal or wish spell is used to restore his
intellect.
When the duration expires, the wizard's lifeforce immediately returns to his body. If the
undead creature is destroyed with the caster
linked, the caster is immediately forced back into
his body and must make a system shock roll for
5d6 damage (or half).
A reverse form of the spell was later developed, called Strahd's frightful joining. This spell
has its own listing.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (ToM).

Bloodstone's Spectral Steed
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 steed
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a wizard to create a quasireal, vulturelike creature. The flying steed can
carry the caster and one other person per three
levels of the wizard's experience (four at 12th
level, five at 15th, etc.). All passengers must be
named specifically during the casting.
The spectral steed looks like a huge, skeletal
vulture with tattered wings. As it flies, it utters
hideous screeches that echo through the sky. The
spectral steed flies at a movement rate of 48 (MC
D). It appears with a bit and bridle, plus one
saddle per passenger.
All normal animals shun the spectral steed and
only monsters will attack it. The mount has AC 2
and 10 hit points, plus 2 hit points per level of the
caster. Ifit loses all of its hit points, the spectral
steed disappears. It has no attack mode.
The material component is a hollow bone from
a vulture's wing, which must be carved into a
whistle and blown when the spell is cast.
Notes: Uncommon or rare (ToM).

Bloom
(Conjuration)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 6 turns
Area of Effect: 1 sq. ft./level
Saving Throw: None
The casting of this spell causes a bundle of
feather-light, brilliant flowers of the caster's choice
to appear before him. The flowers are extremely
lightweight and will catch any breeze and drift like
dandelion seeds. They last only an hour, then dissolve without trace. Wizards commonly choose a
particular type of flower as a signature and call
upon them to appear with this spell.
Non-elves tend to view this spell as a useless
conjuration typical ofthe elves. The Daleland
elves, however, use it in courting, decoration, and
celebration. In one case, a sage escaped a dragon
by tossing a large bundle of carnations into the
beast's face, and fled while the beast (fortunately
allergic) was sneezing.
Notes: Common to Daleland elves of the
FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; uncommon for conjurers; otherwise rare.

Blossom — Pluma
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 day
Duration: Instantaneous
Area ofEffect: One 100 yd. square/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell requires a full day of concentration
on the part of the caster, and must be performed
in the center of the area to be affected. The area
immediately becomes more verdant and fertile
than it was before—if it was dry, the soil grows
moist; if it was fetid swampland, the water drains
away to reveal fresh loam.
The improvement is a matter of degree—a
truly terrible drought cannot be overridden by
this spell alone, though it might in combination
with water summoning. The effects last until the
end of the current growing season.
The material components of the spell are an
ear of grain and a skin of water (about a gallon).
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Blur
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 3 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When a blur spell is cast, the wizard causes
the outline of his form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all
missile and melee attacks against the caster to
be made with —4 penalties on the first attempt
and —2 penalties on all successive attacks. It
also grants the wizard a +1 bonus to his saving
throw for any direct magical attack. A detect
invisibility spell will not counter this effect, but
the 5th-level priest spell ¢rue seeing and similar
magic will.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Body Link
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, a wizard can prevent deathby
decapitation or dismemberment. The spell links the
parts of the caster's body, so that separation from
the main body will not impair them in any way. For
instance, a wizard's head could be cut off yet still
talk, or even eat, as if it were still attached to the
caster's body; if an arm is cut off, the caster still has
muscular control and can even wield weapons. If
the head is cut off, the body falls limp unless the
caster rolls a successful Intelligence check.
The base duration of the spell is one turn per
caster level, during which time the spell passively
waits to take effect. Once the head or any limb is
cut off, the spell continues for one round per caster
level. During this time, if the limb or head is placed
back on the trunk, it immediately reattaches.
This prevents harm only from decapitation or
dismemberment; other damage applies normally,
Thus, while the spell is proof against beheading
or a vorpal sword, the caster can still be killedby
an accurate sword thrust. Also, since the body
sometimes falls limp when the caster loses his
head, it is a good idea to have a friend nearby to
reattach the head before the duration ends.
The material components of the body link spell
are a pearl worth at least 500 gp, which is
destroyed during casting, and a small amount of
tree sap, which must be consumed by the caster.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise
very rare.

Body Outside Body
(Conjuration)
Level: 7
Range 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time. 1
Duration: 1 rd./2 levels
Areaof Effect: 1 duplicate/S levels
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wu jen to create one or
more duplicates of himself. These duplicates have
the normal ability scores and personality of the
102 N\ Bone Blade ge
wu jen. They carry all the normal equipment of
the wu jen, but have none of his magical items.
Neither do they possess anyof the spell abilities
ofthe wu jen. Their hit points are one-fourth
those of the caster. When created, they are obedient to the caster and cooperative with each other,
essentially having the same mind.
The duplicates can do anything of which the wu
jen is normally capable, except cast spells. They
suffer damage as do normal individuals except that
ifslain they instantly disappear. Each time a duplicate is slain, the caster suffers 10 points of damage.
At the end of the spell duration, all duplicates disappear without causing damage to the wu jen, of
course. The duplicates are indistinguishable from
the caster, even to a true seeing spell.
The material component for this spell is a few
hairs from the wu jen's head or beard.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; very rare
elsewhere.

Bombard — Old Empire
(Evocation)
Level: 8
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: 1 rd./4 levels (round down)
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw:
When this spell is cast upon a single creature
within spell range, giant stones appear and bombard
the target, inflicting 10d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage by
half. Each successive round, a new bombardment
strikes the target, causing 10d6 points of damage.
This spell lasts one round for every four levels
of the caster, rounded down (thus a bombardment
from a 16th- through 19th-level wizard lasts four
rounds, a bombardment from a 20th- through
23rd-level wizard lasts five rounds, etc.). Each
bombardment after the first round strikes before
any other actions take place in the round.
A creature with magic resistance checks each
round—a successful resistance roll ends the spell.
This check is made before taking bombardment
damage for the round. The spell ends if the target
moves out of range. A successful dispel magic
spell cast on the target negates the spell.
The material component for this spell is a
piece of meteoric iron.
Notes: Rare spell. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old
Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor
or a read Southern magic spell.

Bone Blade
(Alteration, Evocation, Necromancy)
Level: 8
Components: Range: 0 V, S, M hy
Casting Time: 8
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 blade
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a temporary but very effective
weapon. The blade created can be wielded by any
being normally able to wield edged weapons. It is
identical in size, weight, and damage to the bladed
weapon that serves as a material component of the
spell. The bone blade has several special properties.
+ It is unbreakable until it crumbles into dust at the
spell's expiration.
* It is a magical weapon for attack purposes.
+ An undead creature struck by a particular bone
blade for the first time must successfully save vs.
death magic or be blasted instantly out of existence; ifa creature of8 Hit Dice or more is
destroyed in this manner, the bone blade is
instantly destroyed also.
+ The blade inflicts double damage agaist undead,
+The blade deals damage against undead as a
sword of wounding. (The undead creature suffers
one additional point of damage per round per
wound; a round spent treating a wound negates
this special effect for that wound; magical curing
is ineffective against such wounds.)
The material components for the bone blade
spell are a normal bladed weapon and a bone from
any source; both are consumed in the casting.
Notes: Uncommon in savage settings or among
wizards allied with Beast Cults; otherwise very rare.
Known to be in The Book of Shangalar the Black.

Bone Blight
Reversed form, see bone growth.
Bone Club
(Enchantment, Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration. 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 bone
by
Saving Throw: None
A wizard can use this spell to enchant a bone,
causing it to become a magical club. This magical
weapon acts as a club +/ inflicting 2-7 (1d6+1)
points of damage. The club can be wielded without penalty by any individual with a club weapon
proficiency.
The material component for this spell isa
pinch of dirt from a grave. The bone could be
from any animal, providing the bone normally
could be wielded asa club; for instance, a human
femur could be enchanted by this spell, buta
skull could not. At the end of the spell's duration,
the club reverts to a normal bone.
Notes: Uncommon in savage settings or among
wizards allied with Beast Cults; otherwise very
rare.

Bone Dance
(Necromancy)
Level:
Range: 10 yds/level
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 3 rds.
Duration: 3 turns/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell temporarily animates the physical
remains of a human, demihuman, or humanoid. The
bone dance spell forges a mystical link with the
newly made undead creature, enabling the caster to
mentally control its movements, just as a puppeteer
manipulates the actions of a wooden puppet.
The skeleton or zombie animated by this spell is
incapable of carrying out any independent actions—
the wizard must mentally command the undead
puppet to walk forward, pick up a sword, strike an
opponent with it, and so on. A caster concentrating
on the bone dance spell cannot speak, cast other
spells, or actively engage in melee. The spell occupies the greater part of the caster's attention.
The skeleton or zombie animated by this spell is
exactly as the monster described in the Monstrous
Manvat Tome. It can be affected by spells that
affect undead, and can perform simple actions:
grasping, lifting, and carrying; opening and closing
unlocked doors, windows, or chests; crude mixing
and stirring; and so on. If directed into combat, it
fights as a regular skeleton or zombie.
When combined with the spectral voice spell,
bone dance can make for an effective decoy, a
menacing bluff, or at least a ghastly form of
entertainment. When augmented by corpse link, a
dancing cadaver can serve as an effective (and
ultimately expendable) scout that can work
beyond the immediate visual range of the caster.
The spell ends if the caster's concentration is
broken. It also ends if the caster causes the skeleton to move beyond spell range or out of direct
sight (corpse link and similar spells lift this
restriction). The skeleton or zombie can be
destroyed in combat, or the bone dance spell broken by a successful dispel magic.
The material component is an intact skeleton
or corpse and a small, crude puppet that the
caster must manipulate with both hands to choreograph the bone dance.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.

Bone Form
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1-20 hrs.
Area of Effect: Sufficient bones for the spell
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the caster is able to create any object less than 3 feet long, high, and
deep out of bone matter. The caster must have a
supply of bones on hand to create whatever object
1 itdesires. Weapons can be created with this spell;
1 such weapons are evil, but not magical for pur-
1 poses of striking creatures hit by magical weapons. They also give no bonuses or penalties to
attack or damage rolls.
The material components of this spell are
enough bones to construct the desired item and a
drop of body fluid (spittle, blood, etc.).
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and undead
spellcasters; uncommon.

Bone Growth
(Alteration, Necromancy)
Reversible
Level: 5
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Instantaneous + special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This healing spell fuses normal fractures: Mild
compression fractures heal in a day, while more
serious fractures (such as a broken leg or back)
might take 1-4 days to heal (assuming complete
bed rest for the patient; otherwise healing time is
doubled). This spell does not heal soft tissue
damage, including cuts and sprains, nor does it
correct improper alignment of the bones while
healing. It has no effect on undead. It also immediately halts the effects of the bone blight spell,
and slowly (over a period of 1-6 days) restores all
damage caused by that spell.
This spell can also restore damage to exoskeletons, shells, and bony carapaces, but the time
requirements are doubled.
The material component for bone growth is a
drop of milk.
The reverse, bone blight, is an evil, deadly curse
that slowly erodes the healthy bones of any chosen
creature within range. If a saving throw vs. spell is
failed, all bones in the creature slowly begin to dissolve, eventually reducing it to a quivering mound
of formless flesh. It has no effect on undead.
Except for experiencing a strange "tingling
sensation" at the time of casting, the victim is not
immediately aware of the spell's effect (making it
even more insidious).
In the short term (from the moment of casting to
the first full day), the bones of the victim become
brittle, greatly creasing susceptibility to crushing
attacks or falling damage. The victim sustains double damage from these; by the end of the first day,
current hit points are reduced by 20%.
In the mid-term (lasting 1d6+1 days from the
time of the casting), the victim is subject to frequent, painful fractures. Piercing and slashing
weapons inflict double damage, while bludgeoning or crushing attacks inflict quadruple damage.
By the end of this period, the victim's hit points
are reduced by 60%.
In the terminal stage, the victim's bones finally
dissolve, collapsing the spine and skull, bringing
a slow and painful death.
This spell prevents natural healing. Magical
healing slows, but cannot stop, the terminal stage.
Every 10 points of magical healing prolongs the
intermediate stage for one full day, to the maximum
limit of one day per point of Constitution. The slow
dissolution of bone can be halted only by a remove
curse, a cure disease followed by a successful dispel magic, a heal followed by a restoration spell, a
limited wish, or a wish. Once the spell has been
broken, lost hit points can be healed normally or by
magical means.
The material component is a drop of aqua
regia.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and
(optional) Healer mages. Casting the reversed
form is an evil act and will have alignment
repercussions.

Bone Javelin
(Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration. 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 javelin
Saving Throw: None
A bone Javelin springs into being in the air
above the caster's hand and flashes as the caster
points, at a movement rate of 30. The javelin
turns after striking or reaching maximum range,
returning to the caster at the same speed. It floats
above the caster's hand until sent forth again.
Spellcasting or other activities can be performed between javelin casts without sending
forth or dismissing the javelin. The javelin can
twist and turn as necessary to overcome barriers
and return to its caster. It strikes only once per
round, requiring a successful attack roll. Other
creatures in the javelin's path may be imperiled
if the javelin misses the target first chosen by
the caster.
The javelin inflicts 1d4 points of damage, plus
1 point per level of the caster. It can damage
undead, ethereal, other-planar, and Prime Material Plane creatures alike. The javelin is AC —4 and
shatters if dealt at least 7 points of damage.
This magic requires a tiny carved replica of a
javelin fashioned of any organic material, a drop
of the caster's blood, and a bone fragment, all of
which are destroyed in the casting.
Notes: Uncommon in savage settings or among
wizards allied with Beast Cults; otherwise very rare.
Known to be in The Book of Shangalar the Black.

Bone Knit
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, 8, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 skeleton
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to rejoin the pieces
of a skeleton. All of the pieces of the skeleton
must be present for the spell to work. The wizard
casts the spell, then places his hands over the
bones or as close to them as possible (1 foot maximum distance).
The bones then transform themselves into a
whole skeleton. If this newly jomed skeleton is
then animated with an animate dead spell, it
will have maximum hit points. The spell can be
cast upon an undead skeleton that has not been
utterly destroyed in order to "heal" it of any
damage that has been inflicted upon it by physical attacks.
This spell can be cast upon an undead skeleton
in conjunction with a permanency spell to create
a skeleton that "regenerates" 1d4 points of physical damage every second round (fire and acid
damage and the effects of undead turning cannot
be regenerated).
The material component of this spell is a drop of
the spellcaster's blood and a dropof troll's blood.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and undead
spellcasters; rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Bone Seize
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1-10 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
With this spell, the caster can take control of
the victim's bones. It does not matter whether the
target is alive or dead. Control is awkward at best,
The caster can make the subject walk, lay, and sit
down only; the subject cannot be made to fight,
cast spells, speak, jump, etc.
Notes: Restricted to undead spellcasters;
uncommon.

Boneiron
(Enchantment) .
Level: 2 ff
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: Weapon(s) touched
Saving Throw: None
This lesser version of the 4th-level enchanted
weapon spell transforms bone weapons into their
7 XN\ Bowgentle's Fleeting Journey agmetal counterparts with regard to attack and damage capabilities. It affects one large or medium
weapon or two small weapons. Any penalty for
material strength is thus removed, and the weapon
has no more chance of breaking than if it was
iron. Multiple castings on a single weapon have
no additional effect. If cast on a missile, the spell
ends when the missile hits a target. The spell also
can be used in the creation of permanent magical
‘weapons of bone.
The material component for this spell is the
tooth of a carnivorous animal.
Notes: Common in savage settings or among
wizards allied with Beast Cults. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Bones of the Earth
(Necromancy) anal
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3 rds.
Duration: 1d20 + 10 days
Area of Effect: Creates 1 or more structures
Saving Throw: None
Drawing on the life force of the very world,
the caster is able to create minor structures out
of subterranean materials. When cast, a structure, not more than 20 feet high and 10 feet
wide at the base per Hit Die of the caster, rises
from the ground. The structure is simple and
solid, and it can appear in any form the caster
desires. It takes two rounds to form, and is
always accompanied by extremely loud rumblings. The structure lasts for the duration of
the spell, after which it recedes back into the
ground. Any inside must exit or be trapped
(doomed at the DM's option).
Multiple structures can be created, but they
are divided among the caster's total available
mass. For example, an 11 Hit Die lich could create one 220-foot tall structure, or eleven 20-foot
tall structures.
The spell can be cast to renew existing structures created by the spell. The rumblings occur at
the time of casting, but nothing actually moves.
Should the spell be dispelled before its conclusion, its structures take two rounds to sink back
into the ground.
The material components for this spell are a
stone and a weed.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and undead
spellcasters; uncommon.

Bonewood
(Alteration) .
Level: 2 ff
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: Weapon(s) touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell toughens crude wooden weapons to
be the equivalent of a bone counterpart. The
weapons are also fireproof while the spell lasts.
One large, one medium, or two small weapons
can be affected by a single casting of this spell;
missiles revert to normal upon hitting a target.
Repeated castings provide no additional benefits.
Anyone wishing to create a permanently
strengthened bone weapon must use enchant an
item and permanency spells as well. Aside from
being fireproof, normal wooden weapons such as
clubs and staves gain no additional benefit.
The material components for this spell are a 3-
inch strip of wood and a bone of roughly equal
length.
Notes: Common in savage settings or among
wizards allied with Beast Cults; otherwise rare.
(Updated from Deacon Magazine.)

Bowgentle's Fleeting Journey
(Alteration)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
By casting this spell and touching the target creature, the caster sends that individual to another
location within sight. The individual remains at the
location for one round, at the end of which time he
is teleported back to his initial location.
This teleportation must be to an area viewed and
pointed at by the spellcaster when casting the spell.
The range is up to 20 yards per level horizontally
and 10 yards per level vertically. The teleportation
operates as the Sth-level wizard spell of the same
name, but the location will not be less familiar than
"seen casually." The individual might teleport high
or low as listed. If teleported into a solid object the
individual is not slain, but rather pushed into the
Astral Plane. An individual pushed into the Astral
Plane must get back to the Prime on his own, as the
spell will not return him.
Should the teleportation be successful, the
individual can immediately act in the next
round, performing any one-round action (most
spelicasting, moving, attacking, picking up an
item, etc.). A maximum of 500 pounds of character and equipment can be teleported in this
fashion. If the individual is overloaded (or
secured by chains, ropes, webs, or other ties),
the teleportation fails.
At 15th level, the caster can send the recipient
of the spell to a location for two full rounds
instead of one Regardless of level, the caster
cannot send himself anywhere with this spell, or
send dead bodies or inanimate objects alone.
The material component of this spell is a small
ball of uncured rubber.
Notes: Rare. Known to be in Bowgentle's
Book.

Brain Spider
(Divination, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 8
Range: 20 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows the caster to eavesdrop on the
thoughts of up to eight other beings at once, hearing as desired:
+ The ceaseless chaos of surface thoughts and
images, or
+ Individual trains of thought in the order the
caster desires, or
+ Information from all minds about one particular
topic, thing, or being, one nugget of information
per level of the caster.
+A studyof the thoughts and memories of one
creature of the group in detail.
Once per round, in any round in which no such
detailed studying occurs, the caster can attempt to
implant a suggestion (similar to the 3rd-level wizard
spell) in the mind of any one of the eight creatures.
This spell can affect all intelligent beings of
the caster's choice within range (up to the limit of
eight), beginning with known or named beings.
The beings need not be personally known to the
caster, who can choose, for instance, "the nearest
eight guards who must be in that chamber there"
Those who make a successful saving throw vs.
spell cannot be reached by the spell.
Creatures who are psionically gifted or who are
in the process of casting or using any enchantment/charm spell when contacted by a brain spider probe are instantly aware of it. They learn its
source's identity and general location, though the
caster is not warned of this. Such creatures automatically escape all spell effects and do not count
as any of the eight beings affected. Creatures who
are insane or feebleminded cannot be affected by
a brain spider, and contact with their minds
inflicts upon the caster 1d4+1 points of damage
per deranged mind touched.
The material component of this spell is a spider of any size or type. It may be dead, but must
retain all of its legs.
Notes: Very rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS
setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Brainblaze
(Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to transform his
body into a pillar of pure life energy. The body
appears to "fall away" to reveal a pillar of bright
white light of the same height and in the same
location as the body occupied. This pillar can
~~"float" hanging in midair, if no surface exists for
it to rest on, and it cannot be harmed by nonmagical means. A caster could use this spell to avoid
the effects of a hail of arrows or other physical
attack that could not otherwise be avoided. The
pillar flies at a movement rate of 21 (MC A).
Brainblaze bolts: The pillar of life energy evoked
by the spell cannot cast spells but can hurl one or
more bolts of itself at any living target, using the
caster's base THAC0. Such attacks do not diminish
the pillar's vitality and fade away if they miss. Those
struck suffer damage and spell draining depending
on the number of attacks the caster makes.
Ifa brainblaze bolt contacts a mind that contains memorized spells, it steals a random spell;
the caster instantly gains the stolen spell and
can cast it after the brainblaze spell's expiration
ifthe necessary material components are available. The stolen spell is always from one of the
three most powerful spell levels memorized by
the target. Stolen spells dissipate after 24 hours
ifnot used.
Number of Damage/ Max. Spell Level
Bolts Bolt Stolen
One 15d10 8
‘Two 10d8 7
Three 10d6 6
Four 10d4 $
Any creature that touches the main pillar of life
energy loses 10d4 points, but is not subject to
spell stealing. A successful saving throw vs. death
magic allows an unwilling creature to dodge a
touch attack initiated by the caster.
The caster must make a successful Constitution check to reform his body; failure means the
essence of the wizard is doomed to wander, aware
but silent, until some means of gaining a body or
receptacle is found (this typically requires the aid
of another magic-using being)

Magazine.)

Brainkill
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
A wizard using this spell, which operates much
like the 2nd-level forget spell, can permanently
burn from the memory of any one creature all
knowledge of either a specific place, a person, or
atime period of up to one year (the spellcaster
can choose the desired result). The spell works on
any intelligent creature by destroying a portion of
its brain, but a victim is entitled to a saving throw
vs. death magic to resist the effect of the spell. If
successful, the creature suffers only a painful
headache, which dissipates in 1d4 hours but is
otherwise harmless. If failed, the victim suffers
1d6 points of damage from an excruciating
headache, leaving him with selected gaps in his
memory.
The brainkill spell affects only memory and
the ability to recall factual information. For
example, a person thus affected might be completely unable to remember details of a place, the
name, appearance, or any traits of a person, or
might have a one-year blank in his or her memory. The spell has no effect on learned abilities or
skills. For instance, an individual who gained a
swimming proficiency six months before coming
under the influenceof this spell would no longer
recall the swimming lessons, but still retains the
ability, (though it might not become evident until
the subject jumps into a large body of water).
Aside from relearning lost knowledge as best as
one can, "killed" memories cannot be regained
except by a wish.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Brannart's Acidic Grip
(Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
The acidic grip spell coats a caster's hand with
a highly potent acid. The caster remains immune
to the effects of this acid for the spell's duration.
Any creature the wizard touches with a successful melee attack suffers 1d3 points of damage,
plus 1 point per level of the caster. The exposed
creature takes this damage each round of exposure; those the caster grabs and holds suffer damage each round until they break free.
The caster can use Brannart's acidic grip to
destroy inanimate material; it burns a hand-sized
hole through 2 inches of wood or 1 inch of metal
in a single round. Magical materials are immune
to the effects of the acidic touch.
The spell was created by the Glantrian wizard
Brannart McGregor.
Notes: Rare or very rare.

Breach the Beast's Defenses
Mysrara setting spell, aka breach defenses.
7Breach Defenses
Breach Defenses
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Components: V, S,M
Range: 20 yds.
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The bane of magical creatures, breach defenses
temporarily negates the magical defenses of a creature otherwise immune to normal weapons. Once
drained of its magical protection, the creature
becomes vulnerable to normal weapons and its
Armor Class is worsened by 2 (from AC 4 to AC 6,
for example) to a maximum of AC 10, Under this
insidious spell's power, wraiths become more tangible, iron golems soften, and lycanthropes must
fear more than silver weapons. Breach defenses has
no effect on a creature's magic resistance or saving
throws, nor does it remove natural or magical
immunities to certain forms of attack (for example,
a salamander or baatezu's resistance to fire). It simply drains a creature's magical defenses, whether it
normally would suffer damage only from +1 or better magical weapons or from +3 or better weapons.
Wizards under the effects of a wraithform spell
also subject to this spell's effects.
The material components are one marble-sized
ball of iron and one of glass.
Notes: Very rare.

Breath of Bewilderment
(Evocation)
Level: 2
Components: V, S
Range: 30 ft.
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: 10 x 10 x 30 ft. cloud
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows the caster to breathe out a visible cloud of smoking vapor. It dissipates one round
later, but all creatures coming into contact with it
must make a saving throw vs. poison or be stunned
for.the following round, during which time no
coherent, deliberate activity is possible. The caster is
never affected by his own breath of bewilderment,
or, if she has this spell memorized, by anyone else's.
Notes: Uncommon in the FORGOTTEN REALMS
setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Breathblock — Dragon
(Evocation)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 50 x 50 ft. shield
Saving Throw: None
The breathblock spell brings into being an
invisible plane of force 50 feet on a side, thatis
totally impervious to all draconic breath weapons. The dragon can create the wall anywhere
within the maximum range, and can instantaneously move it to any point inside that range.
The wall of force can be maneuvered as ashield
to protect the dragon, other creatures, or valuable
objects (that is, treasure). If positioned directly in
front of the mouth of a dragon about to usea
breath weapon, the breath weapon either reflects
or billows back upon the breathing dragon.
Unless the dragon is immune to its own attack
form—which is usually the case—the dragon suf
fers half damage from the breath weapon (save
vs. breath weapon for one-quarter damage). Any
other creatures within 30 feet of the breathing
dragon, but on its side of the breathblock, also
suffer half damage (save for quarter damage).
The most spectacular use of this spell was when
the legendary gold dragon Autophon defeated the
demon Lash and the red dragon the demon used
for a mount. As the red dragon prepared to use its
breath weapon, Autophon cast breathblock. The
red's fire billowed backward around it, causing the
dragon no damage but so enraging the demon that
it attacked its own mount. This took the pressure
off the Autophon long enough for him to slay both
demon and red dragon.
Notes: Restricted to dragons; rare.

Breathe — Old Empire
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the creature touched to
1 breathe normally in places where it would normally suffocate (in water, under an avalanche,
while buried by a sandstorm, etc.).
The material component for this spell is a cloth
that must be held over the caster's mouth during
the casting of the spell.
Notes: Uncommon. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS
Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a
mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Breathsense — Pluma
(Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 20 yds./level
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to sense all breathing creatures, no matter how large or small,
within range, for the duration of the spell (excluding fish and insects). The caster can move, and as
he moves within range of additional creatures he
will sense them. Together with this awareness
comes the knowledge of the creature's approximate size.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Brightsong
(Abjuration, Alteration, Enchantment)
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
1 Seving Throw: None
1 This spell is unleashed by a sung incantation; it
creates free action (akin to that of 4th-level priest
1 spell or the ring of free action) in a spherical area
of effect centered on the caster. In this space
(which moves with the caster), all creatures can
move and attack normally, and the following
1 magical effects are negated or prevented from
forming: web, slow, entangle, forcecage, hold,
and all types of paralysis and petrification, All
Bubka's Superior Identification,
locks, mechanical and magical, are opened, and
all knots are untied.
Beings under any sort of compulsion (such as
charms, geas spells, or psionic influences) are
allowed an immediate saving throw to escape
them upon entering the brightsong's area of
effect. A given brightsong spell allows only one
such attempt per being, regardless of how many
times a being enters and leaves its area of effect.
This spell does not work underwater.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their
apprentices, and select Harpers in the FoRGoTTEN
REALMS setting (rare); otherwise restricted to
bards and song mages.

Bubble Breath
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 30 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creates 1d6 bubbles
Saving Throw: Neg.
‘A wizard casting this spell breathes forth 1d6
bubbles in the direction of one or more foes. He
then must make a successful attack roll for each
bubble, or the bubbles pass harmlessly away into
the air and pop. If the wizard strikes a creature
with a bubble, the creature is instantly coated
with a filmy goo. The goo reduces the creature's
movement rate by half and causes it to suffera —2
penalty to all combat rolls and saving throws. The
material component isa bit of tree sap that the
wizard must swallow.
Notes: Uncommon for invokers; otherwise
rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Bubka's Superior Identification
(Divination)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5 rds.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast, one item can be examined by the wizard in order to identify the nature
of its enchantment. The item need only be hand-
7 iN~ Be lA
held or touched, not worn or used in any way. The
following information can be obtained:
+ One basic magical property of the item is
always revealed to the wizard. This takes one
round. Multiple castings reveal the same property unless the wizard has advanced at least one
level.
+A second magical property might be revealed.
The wizard will know in 1d4 roundsif there is
a second such property, and will need a further 1d3 rounds to identify the nature of this
enchantment. The chance for successfully
identifying a second magical property is 3%
per point of Intelligence, plus 3% per level (to
a maximum of 95%). Failing this check indicates that, as far as the caster can determine,
the item does not possess or contain any additional enchantments.
The spell can be repeatedly cast on the same
item to inquire about third and subsequent magical properties (if there are any), with the same
chance for success as for a second property. However, attempts to confirm earlier detections will
always reveal the same result (even if that finding
was in error). Exact properties are revealed by
this spell, such as the fact that a weapon is a
sword + 1. (If the weapon was also of the flame
tongue variety, this could be discovered only as a
second property.)
In the case of charged items, the number of
charges is treated as a second property and, if
the wizard makes the roll, there is still a 25%
chance that the number of charges is overestimated or underestimated by 2d10% (equal
chance for over or under, but the number estimated will never be less than 1 or greater than
the maximum possible).
Unlike the Ist-level identify spell, casting of
this magic does not subject the wizard to a loss of
Constitution. However, the spell cannot be cast
more than once every two hours due to the intense
concentration it demands, or else the wizard
repeating the spell will at once suffer a severe
headache lasting 1d4 hours and be unable to
memorize or cast any spells for a full 12 hours
after the headache subsides.
The material components for the spell are the
same as for the identify spell, except that the pearl
must be of high quality, at least 250 gp value.
Notes: Rare or very rare. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Bug
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 7
Range: 10 mi./level
Components: V, 8, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1d4 days + 1 day/2 levels
Area of Effect: 1 insect
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a mental link between the
caster and an insect; the insect can be used as
an effective spy. Everything heard by the insect
is heard by the caster via the link, and by concentration the caster can see through the insect',
eyes. Since the caster may be disturbed unexpectedly by something the insect hears, there is
a 20% chance that any effort to concentrate an
activity other than using the insect's vision—for
example, casting a spell, memorizing spells,or
initiating psionic powers—is disrupted by the
audial link.
The caster is also vulnerable to attacks that
affect the insect. Any spells that affect the insect
will affect the caster if they normally would, with
no saving throw allowed. If the insect is killed
while caster is linked to it, the wizard suffers 1d4
points of damage. The caster can break the link
and terminate the spell any time he likes.
For example, a repel insect spell would affect
the bug, but not the caster. A charm person spell
would not affect the bug, and thus would not be
passed to the caster. A sleep spell could affect the
bug, but the caster is too high a level to be
affected. A fireball spell would kill the bug and
inflict 14 points of damage on the caster.
The material components are a live bug of any
type and a crushed rose petal.
Notes: Rare for conjurers; otherwise very rare.
Known to be in Prismal s Pocket Library, Vol. IX

Bugman's Mug
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level.
Area of Effect: 1 mug of water
Saving Throw: None
Bugman, a thoroughly loathsome-looking indi- _
vidual with a heart of gold, created this spell fora _
dwarf friend who often visited. The spell alters
normal water into a magical potion that must be\ Burning Sands
imbibed before the duration ends. The potion
temoves hangovers and other ill effects of inebriation and will negate any current state of drunkenness. It is effective against only alcohol-based
changes in the target's physiology, thus ineffective against drugged stupors and poisons.
The material component is common water
served in a pewter mug.
Notes: Rare or very rare. (Updated from
DRAGON Magazine.)

Burn Path
(Abjuration, Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8 hrs.
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: Special
This powerful destructive magic destroys all
knowledge a wizard has of one path of magic (a
series of related spells). The caster chooses which
path is burned. The spells and formulas of the
path are all instantly forgotten, memorized spells
vanish from the victim's mind, and all spells on
that path must be relearned as if the subject never
knew them.
The spell's effect cannot be reversed, but if the
target's saving throw succeeds, the path is merely
sealed as by a seal path spell. The spell cannot be
teflected, but can be cast only on a helpless or
inconscious recipient.
The material component is a thin sheet of
beaten gold inscribed with the formula for the
spell that serves as the path's starting point; this
special scroll costs no less than 3,000 gp. The
scroll is magically consumed in the casting.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from DraGon
Magazine.)

Burning Hands
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: 4
When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His hands
must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet
of flames: The wizard's thumbs must touch each
other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands spell sends out flame jets 5 feet long
in a horizontal are of about 120 degrees in front
of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the
flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2
points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire
damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell
receive half damage. Flammable materials
touched by the fire burn (for example, cloth,
paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such materials can be extinguished in the next round if no
other action is taken.
Notes: Common spell (PHB)

Burning Sands
(Alteration)
(Province: Sand)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 handful of sand
Saving Throw: None
The burning sands spell is used to cause sand
to become combustible. The sand retains its natural form and texture but gains the flammable
properties of lantern oil. The sand will burn with
a colorless, odorless flame for one hour or until
the end of the spell's duration, whichever is
longer. The burning sands spell can be used as an
attack by hurling the sand at an opponent and
then lighting it. If used in this manner, it functions exactly as does burning oil.
This spell sees most use among nomadic tribes
who do not wish to carry wood for fires through
areas where deadwood is not common. A single
handful of burning sand gives off the same heat
as a small campfire and can be used for cooking.
The burning sand cannot be extinguished by any
natural means, making it ideal for use in wet or
windy conditions.
Notes: Uncommon in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Cache — Paramander
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Dimension)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 item, 4 Ib,/level
Saving Throw: None
The casting of this spell upon an item transfers
that item to the Astral Plane for the duration of
spell. Wherever the spellcaster goes, the item
follow on the Astral Plane. When the spell
dissipates, the item will fall into the caster's
nds (if possible) or reappear in front of him if
Nothing can detect the item while it is on the
Astral Plane, except items enabling sight into
"astral space. The chance of the item returning in
damaged or broken condition is 15%, —1% per
‘level ofthe caster. The caster can recall the object
_atany time. Extension spells apply, but trying to
use permanency traps the item on the Astral
Plane forever. The weight limit is 4 pound per
level of the caster. The spell malfunctions if cast
on living things.
Notes: Common for Paramanders (a group of
tare paladin/mages); uncommon for conjurers
and dimensionists; very rare for others. (Updated
from Dr4Gon Magazine)

Cacofiend
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Geometry)
Level: 7
‘Range: 5 yds.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1-8 hrs.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature summoned
Saving Throw: Special
This perilous spell is normally used by NPC
Villains to summon a powerful fiend: a true
fanar'ri, a greater baatezu, or a great yugoloth.
(The cacofiend spell isn't powerful enough to
summon a unique fiend, and lesser sorts can't be
Summoned via this spell.) In any event, the caster
must know the name of the creature he is summoning. A fiend so summoned is most angry and
Cacofiend,
K vilely disposed. The caster must be
warded and protected by a protection
Srom evil spell, and the fiend must be confined within a magical diagramif the wizard is to
avoid being slain or carried off bodily.
If the caster is interrupted during the casting
time, the spell fails. If an interruption occurs after
the fiend has appeared, there is a 10% chance that
it can escape its boundaries and attack the wizard.
The chance is cumulative for each round of interruption. A fiend is entitled to a a special saving
throw against this spell; if the fiend rolls greater
than the caster's level on 2d10, the spell fails (a
roll of 20 always fails). When this occurs, either
the name used was not perfectly correct or the
named fiend is already imprisoned or dead, so the
caster must call on another fiend.
The summoned fiend can be coerced to perform some deed in one of three ways, as follows:
+ By threatening to cast a spiritwrack spell, the
wizard can force the monster to swear an oath to
follow a certain course of action, freeing the
fiend only when the creature completes the service. This method is extremely dangerous, for a
fiend will seize on any minor error in such a
bargain to spoil the desired outcome or to simply kill the summoner. Further, the fiend will
bear great hatred for the wizard after such
forced obedience.
+ By offering tribute (blood and sacrifices), the
summoner may convince the fiend to serve willingly. The caster is well advised to have ample
protection and power to defend himself, for the
fiend might decide the offer is insufficient and
not accept the proffered bargain. Though the
fiend must abide by a pledge, since its name is
known, it must hold only to the exact word of
the agreement, not the spirit. However, only
highly evil wizards are likely to attempt such a
bargain, and a summoned cacofiend might be
favorably disposed toward such a character.
+ The summoned fiend can be the target of a trap
the soul spell. In this case, the wizard will not
speak with or bargain for the creature's service,
although the cacofiend might be eager to reach
an agreement with the wizard before being
forced into imprisonment. Attempting to trap
the fiend is risky only if proper precautions are
ignored, for failure means only that it escapes to
its home plane. If trapped, however, the fiend
remains imprisoned until the owner of the confining object breaks it and frees the fiend, at
which time the wizard must ask the fiend to perform a service before it returns to the Lower
Planes. If the person freeing the fiend fails to
demand a service when the monster asks what is
required of it, the fiend is under no constraint
not to slay its liberator on the spot. If a service
is required, however, the creature must first do
its best to perform the task and then must return
to its home.
The fiend serves only for a limited duration
unless it serves willingly. Any task that is impossible or requires more than a week to perform is
50% likely to free the fiend from its obligations.
A liberated fiend may seek revenge against the
caster, for the creature can remain on the plane it
was summoned to for up to two years.
The components of the spell include white
wax, mandrake root, a bottle of red wine, a piece
of parchment inscribed with the fiend's name,
and an offering tempting to the summoned creature.
Notes: Rare and dangerous. Used mostly by
evil NPC wizards.

Caddelyn's Catastrophe
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1-4 creatures in a 30-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Special
This variation of the fumble spell allows the
caster to affect up to four creatures if desired, all
of whom must be visible to the caster during casting. If four creatures are attacked, their saving
throws vs. spell are normal; if three are attacked,
all save at—I; if two are attacked, they save at —2;
andif only one is attacked, the save is at —3.
Creatures making successful saving throws are
slowed for the duration of the spell (as the 3rdlevel wizard spell). Creatures who fail immediately drop all held objects, if running or charging
they trip or stumble, if balanced on a ledge or
climbing they fall, and if spellcasting they ruined
any verbal or somatic component, spoiling the
spell. Any missile attack by an affected creature
misses and any physical attack is at a —2 penalty.
Weapons are dropped and any weapon attack
becomes a bare fists' attack. Dropped items may
well suffer damage (the DM decides which saving throws, if any, apply).
The material components for this spell are a
banana peel or melon rind and a tallow candle or
lump of animal fat.
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in Caddelyn's Workbook.

Calder's Starry Sky
(Divination) 5
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 turns
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: 10 sq. yds.
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables ships to sail on cloudy
nights or storm-swept days without losing their
way. When cast, the spell causes a display of stars
to appear about 10 yards over the caster's head.
The stars show the correct positions of the stats
in the sky, allowing a navigator to steer by this
projection. The spell can be cast inside a ship's
cabin (or inside a buildingif this is desired for
study or decorative effect), projecting the star
field on the ceiling. The spell fails on cloudless
days.
The material component is an unblemished silver mirror that the caster must direct skyward
during the casting.
Notes: Common in Cerilia (the BIRTHRIGHT
setting); uncommon for Sea mages and diviners;
otherwise rare.

Caligarde's Claw
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Force)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 claw
Saving Throw: Neg,
By meansof this spell, the caster calls into
being an invisible claw of force, similar in many
ways to the numerous Bighy s hand spells. This
claw can be set in an area to attack everyone
within 10 feet, or can be sent against one particular target creature.
If sent against a particular creature, that creature must make a saving throw vs. spell or be
clawed immediately by the invisible force for that
round and every round thereafter for the duration
ofthe spell. If the saving throw is made, the claw
lands 10 feet away in a random direction (as
determined by the grenade-like missile scatter
diagram in the DMG). It is then treated asif it
had been cast on that location.
Aclaw cast on a location will attack the closest
creature within 10 feet with the same THAC0 as
the caster. If it strikes any target (friend or foe, or
even the caster himself) the claw hits automatically every round thereafter.
The claw inflicts 1d4 points of damage per
round It never misses once it hits, but it can be
foiled by any type of magical barrier, including
shield, Bighy's interposing hand, antimagic shell,
and so on. Such spells will not negate its attacks,
but the attacks will be directed against the spell
instead of the target creature. Dispel magic will
destroy the claw. Physical attacks inflict no damage on the claw. The caster can dispel the claw at
will.
Once the claw hits, it remains with the target
regardless of that creature's actions or movement,
even if it moves beyond the spell's original 10-
foot radius. The claw does not interfere with
movement or attacks, but its continual damage
prevents spellcasting (though not the use of
devices or activation words).
The material component of this spell is a dried
foot or claw of some creature.
Notes: Common or uncommon for conjurers;
otherwise uncommon or rare. Known to be in The
Wizard's Workbook.

Call
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creature called
Saving Throw: Neg.
When cast, this spell allows the wu jen to summon any single creature he knows by sight into
his presence. The wu jen must know the specific
identity of the creature called, not just the general
type Calling for a ki-rn is not sufficient, the wu
jen must have a specific ki-rin in mind. Creatures
with names must be summoned by their true
name. A successful saving throw vs. spell allows
the creature to ignore the call. Creatures called
must be on the same plane as the caster. Once
called, the creature is under no compulsion to
remain or aid the caster. Deities and similar powerful beings are not forced to heed the call.
The material components for this spell are a
stick of incense and a strip of paper, burned when
the spell is cast.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; unknown
elsewhere.

Call — Old Empire
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Song)
Level: 9
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a variant of the gate spell. It
attracts the attention of a single native of the
Prime Material plane. The caster calls the name
of the being, who becomes aware that someone
wants him to appear. That individual is free to
accept or reject the call. If the offer is accepted,
the being is instantly teleported without error to a
spot of the caster's choosing, within 200 feet of
the caster.
If the offer is rejected, the call is silenced, and
no teleportation takes place. A demand spell can
be cast prior to this spell to persuade the subject
to accept.
The subject need not be known to the caster,
but his exact location must be; this spell does not
provide the caster with that information. A call
can only affect Prime Material creatures on the
Prime Material planes (it can reach parallel Prime
Material worlds, but cannot reach into the Ethereal, Astral, or other planes of existence.
The material component is a miniature wax
statue of the target.
Notes: Rare for conjurers or Song mages; otherwise very rare. As a ForGorren REALMS Old
Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor
or a read Southern magic spell.

Call of Despair — Elf

Duration: Instantaneous + Special
Area of Effect: 10-ft./level radius

Saving Throw: None
This spell allows members of sorcerous soci
eties to call on their brothers and sisters for aid,
When this spell is completed, the caster desige
nates the direction the spell will travel in orderto
contact a member of the appropriate sorcerous.
society. The spell will travel in that direction fore
number of miles equal to half of the caster's level.
The spell travels in a straight line and, ifit
reaches the end of its range without contact with
a member of the appropriate sorcerous society,
will dissipate harmlessly. If the spell passes
within one mile of a member, it will deliver a plea
for help to that wizard. The plea can be heard by
all members of the sorcerous society within one
mile of the spell's trigger point. The call givesa
rough estimate of the caster's location and a quick
image of the sort of trouble in which the casteris
embroiled.
The spell requires a small amulet that most
members of a sorcerous society are given by their
society. Ifa member tries to cast the spell using
the amulet from another society, the casting automatically fails. The amulet is not consumedby
the casting of this spell.
Members of most sorcerous societies will try
to aid their brethren and will arrive as quicklyas
possible.
Notes: Restricted to society members in arabian settings; very rare at best elsewhere.

Call Spirit
(Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 7
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 spirit
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to summon the
spirit of one specific deceased individual and
question it. The spell must be cast by night,
within 20 yards of the place where the creature's
remains lie. Unlike speak with dead, the amount
oftime that has elapsed since the creature's death
does not matter However, the wizard must know
who is summoned: A name is required
The spirit arrives 1d4 rounds after the completion of the casting. The caster can ask three questions of the spirit, plus one more for every four
levels over 14th (four questions at 1 8th level, five
at 22nd,and so on). The spirit is compelled to
answer truthfully and without evasion if the
answer is known to it
The spirit is 50% likely to know the answer to
any question asked of it. The DM may modify this
ifthe question is particularly relevant to the spirit,
For example, asking the spirit of a hero who took
part in those events would merit a +25% bonus,
while asking a spirit about events that took place
on the other side of the world and five centuries
before its lifetime is not particularly relevant, so a
25% penalty would be appropriate. In addition,
the caster can command the spirit to search the
spirit world for the answer, which grants a +20%
bonus to the chance for an answer. However, this
requires anywhere from 1 turn to one day, depending on the difficulty or complexity of the question.
The caster must wait within range of the spirit's
remains for its return, or the spell is broken and the
spirit is released from its task. If the spirit does not
know the answer and is unable to discover one, it
tells the caster so.
Call spirit lasts until dispelled or until the
caster has received a response for each question
he is entitled to ask. This could require several
days, if the spirit is sent on multiple searches of
the spirit world.
The material component is an item or keepsake
prized by the spirit in life. This vanishes upon
completion of the spell.
Notes: Common for necromancers and
witches; uncommon for diviners; rare for others.

Call Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 100-yd./level radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a wizard to summon any
undead creatures of6 Hit Dice or less within
spell range, but does not give the caster any control over them. A wizard can use this spell to
bring hidden undead out where they can be dealt
with by companions or the wizard's own spells, or
to bring down an undead attack on foes or captors. The call does not allow the undead to unerringly locate the caller.
This spell is effective through water, solid
stone, and all nonmagical barriers, but does not
cross planar boundaries. Affected undead within
the area when the spell is cast immediately move
at full normal rate towards the caster. Note that
the area extends above and below the caster.
Undead with more than 6 Hit Dice may accompany them, but are not compelled to do s
This spell can be used to bring back previously
turned undead, forcing another turning attempt.
The material component is a piece of bone
from any creature tied with a string.
Notes: Common for necromancers; otherwise
very rare.

Callistram's Gondola
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 gondola
Saving Throw: None
The spell creates a small wooden gondola. At 12
feet long by 4 feet wide, the boat holds three to
four passengers plus a (nonmagical) gondolier. Its
enchanted nature causes the craft to glow with a
glittering radiance most would find ostentatious.
The virtually indestructible conjured gondola
moves through water so smoothly that even the
meager strength of an unseen servant can pole
the craft along easily. The small rudderless boat is
far too light to use in any body of water larger
than a small pond or a calm canal. The boat is
propelled by a 12-foot pole, which the spell creates with the gondola.
Callistram, a wizard who spent years researching a spell to conjure a magical gondola, must
have cared only for prestige and appearance—his
canal conveyance does not seem very useful, con
sidering the substantial power required to castit
The material components are a bit of wood and
thatch,
Notes: Rare to very rare.

Calm
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Song)
Level: 3

Duration: 1 hr.
Area of Effect: 70-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special
Insects, animals, demihumans, humanoids, and
monsters of 5 Hit Dice or levels—or less—within
the spell's area of effect lose their will to fight
when this spell is cast, even if engaged in combat
to the death.
The calm spell affects only those creatures
within the area of effect at the instant of casting.
The caster can deliberately exclude up to 1 crea:
ture per level (presumably, friends or allies) from
the spell's effect. Magic resistance against this
spell is lowered by 15%, saving throws vs. spell
against it are made at a ~2 penalty.
Calmed creatures cannot bring themselvesto
attack any other living thing, although they
defend themselves normally, and their actions are
not restricted otherwise. A creature under this
spell's influence that is attacked gains an immediate saving throw with a +3 bonus to shake off the
calming effect. Any calmed creature remains90
for one hour (6 full turns) or until attacked, even
if it leaves the area.
Notes: Common for witches; otherwise very
rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius/level

effect to the equivalent of calm seas. Chop,
whitecaps, and violent storm waves are eliminated, although there might be a noticeable swell
in the calm water if the sea itself is storm-tossed.
Ships within the area of effect need not make
seaworthiness rolls due to weather, even if the
type of weather otherwise calls for it.
The material component of the calm water
spell is a bottle of oil (worth 100 gp) poured onto
the waves.
The reverse of this spell, churn water, creates
waves within the area of effect that are up to 1
foot tall per caster level.
The material component of churn water is a

this spell, and storm-tossed waters will continue
to batter a ship even though the wind has ceased.
The spell has no effect on fog or precipitation,
only on the wind that accompanies it.

as if the winds were "light breeze" rather than
their current wind speed, although the direction
remains unchanged. Exception: If the wind speed
was "becalmed" it remains "becalmed."

Camouflage — Elf
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius, 1 person/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
The elves jealously guard this spell. It functions only in wilderness settings, allowing the
wizard to instantly and completely hide one person per level of experience, concealing them
against even thorough searches. The spell changes
the coloring and shadowing of the affected individuals to blend in with the natural surroundings.
It is effective against infravision and ultravision
and is especially useful for scouts and infiltrators.
Spell-camouflaged individuals retain all their faculties and abilities, and can emerge from the
magical concealment at any time they desire.
The concealed individuals can move while
magically camouflaged, by creeping slowly up to
10 feet each round. Trying to move faster dissipates the spell. As long as the movement is surreptitious and stealthy ("Look, Thrag! That bush
moving!"), the spell holds. As with the invisibility
spell, if the warded individuals attack they gain a
surprise bonus of initiative and a +4 bonus to hit,
but the spell is immediately broken.
The concealed individuals cannot be detected
except by magic or by moving stupidly. Until the
spell wears off, they enjoy near-total invisibility.
The material component for the spell is a
mistletoe berry.
Notes: Common for elves; very rare or not
available to others.

Candletrick

Area of Effect: 1 candle, lamp, or torch
Saving Throw: None
The wu jen casts this spell on a small fire
source of a type typical for lighting purposes.
During the duration of the spell, the flame cannot
be extinguished by normal means. The candle
will immediately relight if snuffed, except if
placed underwater or in a strong wind (such as
gust of wind), or if the air or fuel supply is cut off.
This spell will not work on fires larger than a
small campfire.
Notes: Uncommon in oriental settings; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DraGon Magaine)

Cantrip
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards
‘during their apprenticeship, regardless of school.
The cantrip spell is a practice method for the
apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute
amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip
spell enables the caster to create minor magical
effects for the duration of the spell. However,
these effects are so minor that they have severe
limitations. They are completely unable to cause
aloss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small,
obviously magical materials. Furthermore, matetials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile
and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a
cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other
spell effects.
Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it
remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to
impress common folk, amuse children, and
brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with
cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music,
brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that
float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to
flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of
bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust
under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant
spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Capacitor
(Alteration)
(Artificer)
Level: 6
Range: 40 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 hr/level
Areaof Effect: Box, up to 8 cu. ft/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows the caster to place an electrically charged trap on a box made of any nonconductive material. The electrical charge will be
delivered to the first mass of metal of greater than
one pound that comes within 10 feet of the box. If
two or more such masses are within 10 feet, the
charge is delivered to the largest mass.
The electrical charge delivers 3d8 points of
damage, plus 1 hit point per level of the caster, to
the creature carrying or wearing the metal mass.
A saving throw vs. spell is allowed; if successful,
the spark is harmlessly grounded (at the DM's
option attracted to the next mass of metal large
enough and close enough to trigger the box). The
box is not damaged by the spell in any case. If the
box is destroyed, any undelivered charge is lost.
The material is a bit of phlegm from a blue or
bronze dragon. After the casting has been completed, the caster speaks a final command word
while still within the spell range of the box. This
command word activates the charge. The largest
size box that can be affected is 8 cubic feet per
level of the caster (for example, 3 x 4 x 8 feet at
12th level).
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from DraGon

Cat Charm — Hishna
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Range: 20 yds./level
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 wk./level
Area of Effect: 1 feline
Saving Throw: Special
This spell allows the caster to charm a jaguar,
ocelot, or other natural feline creature. Unlike the
bird charm spells of pluma, however, it will not
summon the creature to be charmed. The feline
must be visible to the caster and within range for
the spell to take effect.
The charmed cat will understand the rudimentary commands of the caster, and will perform
simple tasks: guarding or fighting, or accompanying the caster. If the cat is sent somewhere
without the caster—to carry a message lashed
around its neck, for example—the cat makes a
saving throw ys. spell every day that it is separated from the caster. If the roll succeeds, the
spell is broken.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of hishna
magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Cat's Grace
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Tim:
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
Just as a strength spell can increase a subject's
physical power for a time, cat's grace can enhance a
subject's Dexterity. All abilities and skills that are
Dexterity-based can be affected by an enhanced
Dexterity score, including reaction adjustment,
missile attack adjustment, defensive adjustment,
Dexterity-based proficiency scores, and adjustments to thief abilities. The exact amount of Dexterity gained depends on the subject's class;
multi-classed characters use the most favorable die.
Class Dexterity Gain
Rogue 1d8 points
Warrior 1d6 points
Wizard 1d6 points
Priest 1d4 points
The spell cannot confer a Dexterity score of
20 or more, and it is not cumulative with any
other Dexterity-enhancing magical or psionic
power. Creatures without Dexterity scores gaina
—1 bonus to AC and a +1 to attack rolls with
missiles for the duration of the spell. The mater
ial component for this spell is a few whiskers
from an elven cat.

Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area ofEffect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
By meansof this spell, the caster hurls any
single item weighing 3 Ibs or less in a straight
line in the direction pointed by the wizard. The
item heads in that direction until it reaches the
range limit of the spell and then falls to the
ground. The item must be loose, freestanding,
not held by someone, and also light enough to
124move. (Otherwise the item will quiver in place
and the spell will be wasted.)
This spell can be used offensively to hurl an
item into an enemy. The item hits the individual
inits path with the caster's THAC0, with a +3
bonus to the roll. The missile is considered a +3
magical weapon for purposes of hitting an opponent but has no damage bonus (note that items
projected by the catapult spell penetrate the protection from normal missiles spell). The damage
caused depends on the item catapulted but uses
the guidelines provided.
Notes: Uncommon spell. Known to be in
Detho''s Libram.
Catapult Damage Guidelines
Weapon ‘As normal weapon +1
Small item 2-3 points
Large item (2-3 Ibs.) 2-4 points

Cathala's Compulsion
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 6
Range: 40 ft.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time:
Duration: Maximum 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 being
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell, named for its creator, is cast on any
one being. If the being successfully makes a saving throw vs. spell, the Cathala's compulsion is
wasted. If the saving throw fails, the victim is
forced to charge at the caster until the caster ends
the magic (typically just before impact), the victim manages to touch (usually to smash into) the
caster, or when 1 round per caster level has
- claspsed.
A victim who is prevented from reaching the
caster by a barrier or foe single-mindedly tries to
climb, get past, or batter down the barrier to get
tothe caster. Victims leave themselves vulnerable
to attacks from other beings in their singleminded attempts. The victim can ready any weapons within reach while charging, and the caster
can similarly prepare while the victim is en route,
even casting spells if time allows (if the victim is,
hampered or slowed, perhaps).
A charging creature moves at one-and-a-half
times its full movement rate, has an attack bonus
of +2, and can inflict double damage with certain
Cause Blindness or Deafness,
weapons (such as a lance). Charging victims also
lose all Dexterity-based Armor Class bonuses
and have a base Armor Class penalty of -1. Ifa
charging victim is met with set spears or pole
arms, the opponents gain —2 on their initiative
rolls and can inflict double damage with the set
weapons.
The material component of this spell is a copper hook of any size attached to a string, thread,
or piece of fishing line.
Notes: Rare or very rare in the FORGOTTEN
REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Cause Blindness or Deafness
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
The cause blindess or deafness spell inflicts
the chosen disability on a creature if a successful
touch attack is made and the creature touched
fails a saving throw vs spell. The blindness or
deafness inflicted is of a magical nature.
* Blindness The creature suffers a —4 penalty to
its attack rolls, a +4 penalty to its Armor Class,
and a +2 penalty to its initiative rolls.
* Deafness: The creature suffers a —1 ps
its surprise roll, a +1 penalty to its ii
rolls, has a 20% chance of spell failure for
spells with verbal components, and can react
only to what it can see or feel.

the affliction at will. The dispel magic spell is not
effective. Unlike the 3rd-level priest spell, cure
blindness or deafness, this spell has no reversed
form. This spell is often used in combination with
the second-level spectral hand spell. Casting this

The cause disease spell afflicts the creature
touched with a debilitating or fatal disease at the
caster's option. The spell must be delivered by a
successful touch attack. The creature touched

dispel magic spell is not effective), Lycanthropy
cannot be caused by this spell.
Unlike the 3rd-level priest spell, cure disease,
this spell has no reversed form. The spell can be

Celestial Army — Elf
(Elven High Magic)
Level: 9
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This high magic spell is reserved for use only
in the most dire of emergencies, when the elf
homeland itself is threatened. When cast, this
spell summons a host of beings from the upper
planes who will fight on the side of the caster.
Roll 1d10 and refer to the following table to
determine the type and number of creatures summoned.
Die Roll Beings Summoned
1 1-3 Astral Devas
2 1 Light Aasimon
3 3-18 Lantern Archons
4 1-6 Sword Archons
5: 5-20 Bariaur
6 1 Celestial Lammasu
7 1-3 Phoenixes
8 2-20 Reverend Ones
9 10d10 E:mheriar
10 1 Adamantine Dragon

enemy is defeated or until they are slain. Slain
creatures vanish with any gear they carry and
return to their home plane.
The material components of this spell is a
candle that must be burned at an altar crafted of
precious metals and worth at least 1,000 gp.

Cervate's Summoning
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 2 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a variation of the 3rd-level spell
monster summoning I. However, only one creature of 1 to 2 Hit Dice or levels is summoned. The
caster determines the exact creature to be summoned. If the caster tries to summon a creature
that is no longer living or has more Hit Dice than
the spell effects, the spell fails. The creature
arrives in I1d4 rounds and remains for 2 rounds,
plus one round per caster level (7 rounds at Sth
level, 8 at 6th, etc.). When the spell expires, the
summoned creature is always returned to the
exact spot it was drawn from.
Being summoned so unceremoniously can be a
blessing, in certain circumstances. If the subject
of the spell is snatched away from the jaws of
death, the monster that owns those jaws may
move on before the summoned one returns. A
creature who has fallen into a pit may welcome
the summoning, as it will give his compatriots,
several minutes to figure out how to save him
when he returns. On the other hand, the summoning could just postpone a nasty doom.
The material components for this spell are a
tiny bag, a lit candle, and a token from the creature (a scale or tuft of hair will do), which is
destroyed in the casting.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from Dunceon
Magazine.)

Chain Contingency
(Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 turns
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This powerful spell is similar to the 6th-level
contingency spell. Chain contingency allows the
caster to designate either two or three spells that
will take effect automatically under a specific set
of conditions. In other words, when a set of conditions is met, the designated spells are "cast"
immediately without the caster's intervention.
Chain contingency must be cast together with
the spells it is to trigger. The caster can choose
either two spells to occur simultaneously or three
spells to occur consecutively, one per round.
Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6thlevel contingency spell cannot be included. The
casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of the
spells to be triggered.
Unlike the contingency spell, spells "stored" in
chain contingency can affect creatures other than
the caster. These instructions must be carefully
worded; the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's intentions.
In casting chain contingency, the wizard
defines the conditions that will trigger the
stored" spells. This definition must be carefully
worded, but can be as limiting or general as the
caster desires. The caster also states the exact
order, target, range, and manner in which the
stored spells are to be cast.
The spell has several limitations in triggering
its spells. It does not have any powers of discernment; thus, an instruction to "target the highest
level enemy" is not possible. Furthermore, the
conditions cannot involve a delay; a spell cannot
be ordered to trigger "three turns after I sneeze."
When the named conditions are met, the chain
contingency is automatically triggered. If all
specifics of casting a spell are not specified (e.g.,
target or area of effect), the effect is automatically
centered on the caster.
Possible triggers might includea fall froma
distance greater than the caster's height, the
appearance of the first beholder within 30 feetof
the caster, or the wizard pointing his finger and
pronouncing a specified word.
Only one chain contingency can be placed on
the spellcaster at any one time. If a secondis cast,
the first chain contingency is cancelled, It is pos
sible to have both a contingency and a chain contingency operating at the same time, provided that
there is no overlap in the conditions specified for
triggering the two spells.
Spells triggered by the chain contingency have
a casting time of 1. If the spell is triggered under
conditions that are impossible to fulfill, it fails. If
one of the spells in a series cannot be fulfilled,
the remaining spells in the series are lost. Normal
conditions, including line of sight to the target,
must be fulfilled. All spells originate from the
caster; thus, it is not possible for a caster to tele
port and leave behinda series of fireballs to blast
his enemies. In this case, the fireballs would
either fail or destroy something at the casters
destination .
The material components are (in additionto
those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of
quicksilver; a gom of at least 1,000 gp value; and
an eyelash from an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar"
spell-using creature. The spell also requiresa
small ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not
destroyed) that must be carried by the spellcaster
in order for the chain contingency to perform its
function when triggered.
Notes: Uncommon spell (ToM).

Chain Lightning
(Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 40 yds. + 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 4
This spell creates an electrical dischares ay
begins as a single stroke of lightning, 24
wide, commencing from the fingertips of thal
caster. Unlike a lightning bolt spell, chain li
ning strikes one object or creature initially, then
arcs to a series of other objects or creatu
within range, losing energy with each jump.
The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage
1 per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6
(half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first
strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object
orcreature. Each jump reduces the strength of the
lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object
hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on
this save indicates the creature suffers only half
damage from the bolt.
The chain can strike as many times (including
the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has
levels, although each creature or object can be
struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level
wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less
damage with each strike. The bolt continues to
are until it has struck the appropriate number of
objects or creatures, until it strikes an object that
grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large
cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until
there are no more objects or creatures to strike.
Direction is not a consideration when plotting
chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor—an arc
cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell's range, the
stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune
to electrical attack can be struck, even though no
damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the
chain to arc back to the caster!
Chameleon
The material components are a bit of fur, a
piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and one silver pin for each experience level of the caster.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Chameleon
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell alters the coloration of the creature
to match the surrounding background. This
allows the creature to blend in with the surroundings, making it difficult to spot and attack. At distances greater than 30 feet, the creature cannot be
spotted (although it can be seen if pointed out by
someone standing closer). At 30 feet or closer,
the creature is treated as if it has a 20% chance to
hide in shadows, although it is not required to
remain still. In addition, a creature that can hide
in shadows gains a bonus of 20% to its normal
chance of success if it remains still.
Hi]Those firing missile weapons at a creature protected by the chameleon spell suffer a —4 penalty
to their attack rolls.
When moving through areas where the background changes gradually (such as stepping from
the edge of a forest into a green field), the
chameleon coloration changes automatically.
When the background changes abruptly (from
forest to gray stone wall), one round is required to
for the color to change.
The material component for this spell is the
shed skin of a small lizard.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise
very rare.

Change Form
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Casting Time: 8
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
When the change form spell is evoked, the
caster begins a process that will eventually end
with the complete metamorphosis of the recipient
into an entirely new creature. The change induced
by the spell is total in every respect, both physical
and mental. It occurs regardless of the size of the
recipient. The resultant creature can be as tiny as
an ant, or as huge as a whale. The new form cannot have more Hit Dice than the subject presently
possesses, and it must be a living creature native
to the Prime Material Plane (thus tenar'ri, undead,
baatezu, magical constructs, elemental creatures,
and unique entities are not possible choices).
An initial saving throw vs. polymorph is
allowed to negate the effects of change form, but
if this is failed, only a wish can stop the transformation, which takes place over several weeks.
Furthermore, a wish can only stop the process,
not reverse it, once the physical phase of the
transformation is complete. A second wish can be
used to reverse the process, allowing the subject
to return to normal at the same rate as the initial
change. A third wish speeds up the rate of recovery so that it takes but one day.
If the saving throw is failed, then immediately
after the spell is completed, all characteristics of
the subject, including ability scores, alignment,
form, Armor Class, Hit Dice, etc., move one
place toward those of the end creature; for every
10 days following the spell's casting, they change
one further position. Size is altered at the rate off
foot and 40 Ibs. of gain or loss per day. For exam
ple, an 8th-level fighter who began to change
form into a pech would immediately gain anak
ural Armor Class 9; ten days later he gains AC &
twenty days later he gains AC 7; and forty days
after that, AC 3. During this time, the fighter
would have lost four of his Hit Dice, become ne»
tral good, and otherwise assumed the appearance,
size, form, and general characteristics of an aver
age pech.
The DM arbitrates these changes. When all of
the subject's statistics conforme to those of the
new form, the individual loses all class abilities.
Thus, if we assume that our fighter's changeis
complete on the 70th day, he then loses his fighting ability and now attacks as a 4 Hit Die mon
ster.
One week after the physical phase of the trans
formation is complete, the subject loses all prev
ous memories (except for rudimentary facts
about himself, such as his name, place of birth,
and so forth) and other functions associated with
his previous form such as racial abilities. Instead,
he gains all the special abilities (such as magic:
resistance, special attacks, special defenses, ete)
of his new form, becoming in every respects
member of his new race.
However, in some cases, the change form spell
may not be total: Memories and other mental
functions, such as Intelligence and psionics,
might be retained in the being's new form ifthe
new form is basically the same as the old form
(for example, humanoid to humanoid, avian to
avian, etc.).
Once the metamorphosis is complete, the
recipient grows and ages normally as a member
of his new race. He is able to use all natural abil:
ties of his new form, such as flight and other spe
cial movement modes, asif he were born to them,
though he may not be able to speak the language
of his new form. f
The material component of the spell is a vialof
acid, in which at least 5,000 gp worth of pow
dered moonstone has been dissolved during a full
moon. The vial must be broken upon the subject
within one round of the completion of the spell,
The acid causes no damage to the recipient who
fails the save, although one who successfully
saves takes 2d4 points of damage.

Change Self
(ilusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Duration: 2d6 rds. + 2 rdslevel
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to alter the
‘appearance of his form—including clothing and
equipment—to appear 1 foot shorter or taller;
thin, fat, or in between; human, humanoid, or any
other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The
caster cannot duplicate a specific individual. The
spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms
ofthe chosen form. The duration of the spell is
246 rounds plus two additional rounds per level
of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may
allow a saving throw for disbelief under certain
circumstances: for example, if the caster acts in a
manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen
role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile
fie. touch) properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be discovered in this way.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Chant of the Red Wizards
(Enchantment)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M

such as an attack that causes damage, grappling
the chanter, or a silence spell, breaks the spell.
Multiple chants are not cumulative.
The Red Wizard must have an instrument to
accompany the chant.
Notes: Restricted to the Red Wizards of Thay;

(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Up to 40-ft. cube

spell, but only the following beings receive a saving throw: fighters, wizards specialized in
enchantments, monsters that use no magic and
have an Intelligence of 4 or less, creatures of 21
Intelligence or higher, and creatures with more
levels or Hit Dice than the caster's level.

10 Act normally for one round (then
roll again)
The spell lasts one round for each level of the
caster. Those affected are checked by the DM for
actions each round for the duration of the spell, or
until the "wander away for the duration of the
spell" result occurs.
Wandering creatures move as far from the
caster as possible using their most typical mode
of movement (humans walk, fish swim, bats fly,
etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at
the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an
enemy and acts according to its basic nature.
The material component for this spell is a
small disc of bronze and a small rod of iron.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Chaos Shield*
(Abjuration)
(Wild)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1d10 rds. + 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
Following the discovery of wild magic came the
discovery of wild surges and the personal danger
such surges create. After several wild mages
destroyed themselves by rather spectacular means
(or suffered very odd side effects), the chaos shield
was created as protection from these surges.
This spell imbues the wild mage with special
protection against the effects of wild surges. It
protects only against wild surges caused by the
caster's own spells, not from the effects of another
mage's wild surges.
When a wild surge affects a caster protected by
chaos shield, the caster is allowed a saving throw
vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the effect
of the surge on the caster is negated. If the saving
throw is failed, the caster is affected normally by
the surge. The spell does not protect against wild
surges that might be caused by its own casting.
The chaos shield protects only the caster and
does not negate the effects of a wild surge for
other individuals who might be in the area
effect. The caster cannot voluntarily cancel
protection once he learns the nature of a wild
surge; the chaos shield protects from both good
and harmful effects. Thus, if a wild surge resulted
in a heal spell for all individuals within 10 feet
the caster, the protected caster might not benefit,
while all others in the radius would be healed.
The spell remains in effect until it negatesa
wild surge or the spell duration expires.
Notes: Restricted to wild mages; uncommon
(ToM).

Charge
(Alteration, Conjuration)
(Artifice)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4 rds.
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: Special
The caster of this spell brings forth an electrical charge from the quasi-elemental plane of
Lightning. The charge is placed onto an inanimate object or item to protect it from the touch of
any but the caster.
The charge cannot be placed on creature or
sentient object; in this case, the dweomer fails
and the spell is lost. If the caster tries to cast this
spell on an object already protected by a warding
glyph or spell, then the charge fails.
The first living creature to touch the charged
object is shocked by an electrical discharge for?
points of electrical damage per level of the caster
(save vs. spell for half damage). The spell will not
inflict more than 20 points of damage (a 10thlevel caster or better) and will not harm the caster
in any event.
The charge is transferred through any conductive material, so it is passed through daggers,
metal tools, etc. The charge lasts until triggered
by a living creature, dispelled, or negated by the
caster (by touching the protected object and dismissing the charge).
The material component is a thin strand of
drawn copper wrapped around a small piece of
lodestone.

Charm Animals
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Song)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1d4 hrs.
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius, 2d6+6 animals
Saving Throw: Neg.
This powerful spell affects normal and giantsized versions of nonmonstrous animals. Only
creatures of animal or semi-intelligence can be
affected (1, 2-4). Thus, common wolves or dire
wolves would be subject to this spell, but worgs
‘ae too intelligent and winter wolves are not nor-
‘mal animals because of their breath weapon and
immunity to cold and therefore qualify as monsiers. Up to 13-18 animals can be affected for up
to 1-4 hours. If the animals are under a magical
influence or willing followers of a character such
asa ranger or druid, the caster's influence can be
‘contested. Both the caster and the original master
roll Reaction checks, applying normal modifiers
‘based on Charisma scores. The individual with
the lower modified roll wins the contest. The
caster gains a special -2 bonus to this check in
addition to any other modifiers that may apply.
Ifthe original master fails, the each animal
must successfully make a saving throw vs. spell
orbe charmed. If there are more animals than the
caster can affect, charm animals affects the lowest Hit Dice animals first. Any creature that has
suffered damage from any action of the caster
during the same encounter is immune to the
effects of this spell.
Charmed animals regard the caster as a trusted
ally. They do not gain any ability to understand
her speech, but they instincively protect her from
hostile creatures or foes, and may follow more
complex orders or suggestions if the caster finds
‘Away to make his wishes known. Self-destructive
‘orders are ignored. If the caster harms or attempts
‘toharm an affected creature, the spell is negated.
Notes: Restricted to witches, to kits with
‘exceptional animal affinities, and to those of
‘gypsy blood; common. (Updated from Dragon

(Song)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1d4 + 1 turns
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
The caster must have a Charisma score of at least 11 to cast this spell. The spell affects up to 5-8 men of 3rd level or less in a 15-foot radius, and has a duration of 2-5 turns. "Man" is defined as any male human, demihuman, or humanoid creature of large size (L) or less and 3 Hit Dice or less. It affects them much as a charm person spell, in that the words and requests of the caster will be seen in the most favorable light. If the caster harms or attempts to harm an affected creature, the spell is negated. The spell won't work on any man who has taken damage from any other action of the caster in the current encounter.
A leader with the group of men can negate the charm immediately if the leader's Charisma plus a roll of 1d8 is six points or more higher than the witch's Charisma. If the spell is not negated by a leader, 5—8 men (1d4+4) of 3rd level or less within the area of effect must attempt a saving throw vs. spell.
A successful saving throw negates the effect of the spell for that man only. If there are more than eight men of 3rd level or less in the area, the lowestlevel men are affected first (these count against the spell limit even if they make their saving throws).
Notes: Restricted to female spellcasters; common for witches; otherwise rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

If the leader fails, the men must each attempt a saving throw vs. spells or be charmed. If there art more men within range than the caster can affect, the lowest-level men are affected first (these count against the spell limit even if they make their saving throws).
Charmed subjects regard the caster as a trusted ally. They follow her suggestions and protect her from harm, although self-destructive orders ate ignored. If the caster harms or attempts to ham an affected creature, the spell is negated. The spell won't work on any man who has taken dam age from any other action of the caster in the cur rent encounter. Note that ogres and quadrupeds such as centaurs can be affected.

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time:
Duration: 1d6 + 6 turns
Area of Effect: 1d8+8 men in a 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

"Man" is defined as any male human, demihuman, or humanoid creature of large size (L) or less and 3 Hit Dice or less. Alternately, the spell can be cast on asingle male creature ofany level or Hit Dice. While it will not affect undead of any sort, creatures normally resistant to charm spells, such as elves, are not resistant to this spell.
As with the charm man J spell, the caster's influence can be contested by a strong leader figure among the intended subjects; roll Reaction checks for both the caster and the leader, applying normal Reaction check modifiers based on Charisma scores. The individual with the lower modified roll wins the contest. The caster gainsa special —2 bonus to this check in addition to any other modifiers that may apply.
If the leader fails to contest the witch's influence, the subjects must each attempt a saving throw vs. spells or be charmed. If there are more men within range than the caster can affect, the spell affects the lowest-level men first (these count against the spell limit even if they make their saving throws).
The charmed subjects regard the caster as a trusted ally. They follow her suggestions and protect her from harm, although self-destructive orders are ignored. The spell lasts for 7 to 12 full turns. The spell won't work on any man who has taken damage from any other action of the caster in the current encounter.

Charm Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Song)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is similar to a charm person spell, but it can affect any living creature—or several low-level creatures. The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, although it only affects one creature of4 or more Hit Dice or levls, regardless of the number rolled.
All possible subjects receive saving throws vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any damage inflicted by the caster or his allics in the round of casting grants the wounded creature another saving throw at a bonus of +1 per point of damage received. Any affected creature regards the spellcaster as friendly, an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm. If communication is possible, the charmed creature follows reasonable requests, instructions, or orders most faithfully (see the suggestion spell). If communication is not possible, the creature does not harm the caster, but others in the vicinity may be subject to its intentions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at the very least allows a new saving throw against the charm. Affected creatures eventually come out from under the influence of the spell. This is a function of the creature's level (i.e., its Hit Dice).

Monster Level or Hit Dice	% Chance Per Week of Breaking Spell
Ist or up to 2			5%
2nd or up to 3+2		10%
3rd or up to 4+4		15%
4th or up to 6			25%
Sth or up to 7+2		35%
6th or up to 8+4		45%
7th or up to 10			60%
8th or up to 12			75%

Charm Person
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Song)
Level: 1
Range: 120 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 1 0th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.
The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster's group in the same round the charm is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point ofdamage received is added to the victim's saving throw.
If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for "just a minute or two." Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands).
The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell can be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.
Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.

Intelligence Score	Time Between Checks
3 or less		3 months
4-6			2 months
7-9			1 month
10-12			3 weeks
13-14			2 weeks
15-16			1 week
17			3 days
18			2 days
19 or more		1 day

The time between checks is the time period during which the check occurs. When to roll the check during this time is determined (randomly or by selection) by the DM. The roll is made secretly.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Charm Plants
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Song)
Level: 7
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 10 x 30 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.
The charm plants spell enables the spellcaster to bring under command vegetable life forms and communicate with them. These plants obey instructions to the best of their ability. The spell will charm plants in a 30-foot x 10-foot area. While the spell does not endow the vegetation with new abilities, it does enable the wizard to command the plants to use whatever they have in order to fulfill his instructions. If the plants in the area of effect do have special or unusual abilities, these are used as commanded by the wizard.
For example, this spell can generally duplicate the effects of the Ist-level priest spell entangle, if the caster desires. The saving throw applies only to intelligent plants, and it is made with a —4 penalty to the die roll.
The material components of the spell are a pinch of humus, a drop of water, and a twig or leaf.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Charm Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 undead creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is a necromancer's version of charm monster. By means of this spell, the wizard can bring one or more undead monsters of Hit Dice equal to or less than his level under his influence. A mindless undead such as a common zombie or skeleton equal in number to the caster's level is affected without a saving throw and will serve until the charm is countered or until it is destroyed.
A single undead creature of at least semi-intelligence (Intelligence of 2 or more) can be affected. The undead creature receives a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect, but an undead ofhalf the caster's Hit Dice or less suffers a -3 penalty to its saving throw.
The affected undead regards the wizard as its lord and master, whose edicts are to be obeyed without hesitation. The charmed creature follows all but the most outrageous or selfdestructive orders. If communication is not possible, the creature does not harm the caster and stands waiting for instructions (although it will defend itself if attacked). Any overtly hostile act by the caster breaks the spell. Affected creatures eventually escape the spell's influence; the chance to do so varies with the creature's Hit Dice (see table).

Undead Hit Dice	Escape % Chance/Week
Up to 2 HD	5%
3 t0 4 HD	10%
5 HD		15%
6 HD		25%
7 HD		35%
8 HD		45%
9 HD		60%
10 to 11 HD	75%
12+ HD		90%

The DM should secretly determine the exact time or day of the subject's escape from the spell's influence. Powerful undead will usually (chance) seek to attack the wizard when the spell ends.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Chastise
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Song) ng
Level: 3
Range: 20 feet
Components: V
Casting Time: 3
level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is used to verbally chastise any individual who somehow offends the wizard. The offense must be real (e.g., ifa wizard catches someone trying to pick his pocket). If the wizard tries to chastise someone for an imagined slight, the spell has no effect.
If the target fails his saving throw, he will feel an overwhelming need to abase himself before the caster. The target must perform menial services for the wizard for the duration of the spell, all the while apologizing profusely for doing anything that might further offend the wizard.

Chill Fire
(Alteration) Level: 3 wt
Range: 10 yds
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 turn/level
Areaof Effect: 40-yd. radius
Saving Throw: None or Neg.
The chill fire spell functions only in the phlogiston, and casting it in other surroundings is use less. In the phlogiston, however, the spell reduces the flammable nature of the phlogiston for one full turn per level of the caster. A 1Sth-level wizard could reduce the flammability of an area the size ofhis ship for 15 turns.
When this spell is in effect, the flammable nature of phlogiston is reduced. Though a fireball spell will still center on the spellcaster who created it, the damage caused by the fire will be normal. This applies to both magical and nonmagical fire.
The material component of the chill fire spell is a sliver of glass or ice.
Notes: Common for spellcasters from aspelljamming culture; otherwise very rare.

Notes: Uncommon for conjurers and necromancers; otherwise rare.

Chromatic Blade
(Alteration)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd_/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 blade
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a shimmering blade of constantly changing hue, of needle-width and magical sharpness. The blade glows at all times with a gleaming shimmering radiance that flickers between colors continually and uncontrollably. It is safe to touch a chromatic blade only at its hilt or guard; the blade itself is all edges and even its lightest touch will cause harm.
While the blade can be wielded by any creature, the caster can will it out of existence when he chooses. The blade is considered a +1 magical weapon for attack purposes (no damage bonus). It weighs nothing and makes no sound upon impact. Its merest touch inflicts 2d4 points of damage and it can sever extremities like a sword of sharpness (see table). Ifa sever result is achieved against an individual in +3 or better magical armor the chromatic blade shatters into shards of colored light without inflicting any harm at all.

Opponent		Score to Sever*
Normal/armored		19-21
Larger than man-sized	20-21
Solid metal or stone	21

* Natural roll, considering only the blade's +1 attack bonus.

The bearer of a chromatic blade is protected from color spray attacks, which will shatter upon the blade as soon as they come into contact it.A prismatic spray can be likewise scattered but the blade loses 2d6 rounds of duration. The blade can destroy one color of a prismatic sphere or one color of a prismatic wall upon contact but the blade is destroyed.
A great blow can be struck with the blade so as to shatter the entire sphere or wall, but has a 50% chance to suffer the effects of all of the colors simultaneously (any saving throws are allowed) while leaving the barrier intact. 1
A chromatic blade can be destroyed by a successful dispel magic, disintegrate, or properly worded limited wish. It cannot be physically damaged in any way by weapons of less than +3 enchantment although it can be parried or blocked like a normal blade. A chromatic blade is not affected by changes in light or darkness or by magnetic effects. The blade cannot be mentally wielded or influenced from a distance except for the caster willing it out of existence.
The material component of this spell is a small lightning-tempered dagger set with gems of the seven spectrum colors, the total worth no less than 100 gp.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Tasso' Arcanabula.

Chromatic Orb
(Alteration, Illusion)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Creates 1 orb
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes a 4-inch-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. Within the limits described below, the sphere appears in a variety of colors; each color indicates a different special power. The caster can hurl the sphere at an opponent up to 30 yards away, providing there are no barriers between the caster and the target. If the target is no more than 10 yards away, the caster's attack roll is made with a +3 bonus. If the target is 11-20 yards away, the caster's toll is made with a +2 bonus. If the target is 21-30 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +1 bonus.
If the chromatic orb misses its target, it dissipates without effect. If the target creature makes a successful saving throw, the chromatic orb is also ineffective. Otherwise, the color of the orb determines the amount of damage inflicted and its special power, as summarized on the table; details of the special powers are listed below. The caster can create a single orb of any color listed for his level or lower; for 1 instance, a 3rd-level wizard can create an orange, red, or white orb.
The material component for this spell is a gem ofthe appropriate hue or any diamond. The gem must have a value of at least 50 gp.

Light (pearly white): Light from the orb causes the victim to become surrounded by light to a tadius of 20 feet, asif affected by a light spell. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time the creature attacks and saves at a—4 penalty, and its AC is penalized by 4.
Heat (ruby red): Heat from the orb is intense though to melt 1 cubic yard of ice. The creature loses 1 point of Strength and 1 point of Dexterity (if no ability scores are given, attacks are —1 to hit and AC is penalized by 1) for 1 round.
Fire (flame orange): Fire from the orb ignites all combustible materials within 3 feet of the
Blindness (amber yellow): The orb causes blindness (4 to attacks and saving throws, AC worse by 4) for 1 round per level of the caster.
Stinking Cloud (emerald green): Gas from the orb in a 5-foot-radius noxious cloud forces save vs. poison or the creature is reeling and unable to tack for 2-5 rounds.
Magnetism (turquoise blue): Magnetism from the orb has an effect only if the victim is wearing ferrous armor. The armor becomes magically magnetized for 3-12 (344) rounds. Other iron objects within 3 feet of the caster will stick tightly to the magnetized armor; only dispel magic or a similar spell can release the stuck before the duration expires.
Paralysis (sapphire blue): The creature must save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed for 6-20 (2d8+4) rounds.
Petrification (amethyst violet): Petrification from the orb turns the victim to stone. A successful saving throw vs. petrification still paralyzes a creature of half the caster's level or less for 2-5 (1d4+1) rounds.
Death (ebony black): The creature dies unless a successful saving throw vs. death magic is made. Success s/ows the creature (as the 3rd-level spell) for 2-8 (2d4) rounds.

Circle — Red Wizard
(Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: Special
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: None
Through use of this spell, the apprentices and allies of a Red Wizard add their power to his, giving him an additional number of spells to cast. The Red Wizard has the number of spells per day of a wizard of his level plus the levels of the wizards in the circle (see table), This has an upper level of 30th level, but does not allow the caster any spells of a greater level than he can normally memorize. The circle spell only increases the number of spells that can be memorized, it does not increase the caster's level for the purpose of casting an individual spell, dispel magic, and so on.
For example, a 12th-level Red Wizard has aa circle of three 3rd-level and three Ist-level apprentices. He has the spell slots of a 24thlevel wizard in regard to the number of spells he can cast (five each of Ist through 6th level). He does not get any spells of 7th level or higher, because he cannot cast spells of those levels. He casts all of these spells as if he were a 12thlevel caster.

The Casting: All members of the circle must be members of the caster's school or its allied schools, Allied schools are defined as the schools on either side of the wizard's school, as shown under the Schools of Magic diagram in the PHB (for example, an illusionist's allied schools are those of Alteration and Enchantment/Charm). A Red Wizard can have as many allies and apprentices in his circle as desired, but the total number of spells the circle allows cannot exceed the abilities of a 30th-level wizard.
To cast this spell, the apprentices join in a circle with the wizard in the center. All participants must have previously memorized the circle spell (save the wizard who is to receive the spell's benefits) and must cast it simultaneously. Creating the circle takes a number of rounds equal to the level of the highest apprentice in the circle. (In effect, circles with lower-level apprentices are larger, but cast the circle spell faster.) The casting strips the apprentices of all their memorized spells.
The wizard in the center of the circle must be fully rested. Once the spell has been cast, the wizard then memorizes additional spells up to the maximum number of spells allowed. If the wizard leaves the circle, or if it is disrupted in any way (an apprentice killed or the circle broken by an attack, for example), any remaining unmemorized spells are lost, though the caster retains any spells memorized before the circle was broken.
After the spells are memorized, the wizard can leave the circle. All spells memorized while in the circle are retained until cast.
Notes: Restricted to Red Wizards of Thay; universal for them.

Circle Dance — Drow, Red Wizard
(Divination)
(Song)
Reversible
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 rds
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: The caster, a 10-ft. circle
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to learn something of another creature. The caster dances an intricate, weaving pattern within a 10-foot circular area while concentrating on the target creature and singing a repetitive rhyme ("Reveal to me/For I would see." or the like) that names the target creature concentrated upon.
This naming is a focusing aid, and need not be accurate (nicknames and descriptions can be used). if the spell is successful, the dance ends with the caster receiving mental images and impressions of the target creature. If the soughtafter creature is on another plane, that much is made clear—but which plane, and any details of the current surroundings and state of the target, remain unknown.
If the target creature is on the same plane as the caster, the caster gains a vague idea of how distant the target is from the circle, and some indication of the target's current surroundings and physical or mental state (for example, dead, asleep, unconscious, alert, happy, sad, casting a spell, and so on).
The base chance of success is 4% per level of the caster, plus cumulative bonuses as follows:

+25%	if subject is fairly well knownto the caster (but +40% if subject is intimately known);
+10%	if subject is upset or excited;
+15%	if subject is currently spellcasting or actively using a magical item;
+5%	if the subject is near (within 1 mile per level of caster).

The total percentile score of the caster determines how much the circle dance reveals. A total of 100% yields a clear mental picture of the target's surroundings, and a precise distance and direction to that locale.
The circle dance is is not an ESP spell, and does not allowing hearing of, or spellcasting at a target (but may, for example, aid the caster in teleportation).
The material component is a gem or gems of not less than 1,000 gp total. These are powdered before spellcasting. The caster sprinkles the powder in a circle of at least 10 feet in diameter on any solid surface (which may be temporary). The circle dance is performed within the area.
The reverse of the spell, circle charm, involves the same material component and a reversed dance. It has the effect of hiding the caster (only) and objects on his or her person from all circle dance, locate object, ESP, know alignment, and other spells that locate and divine the thoughts or nature of creatures. This protection lasts for 1 day per level.
Neither form of this spell affects a sending or wizard eye, or functions as any sort of psionic barrier or protective aid.
Notes: Common for drow and Red Wizards of Thay; uncommon for song mages; rare for others. Known to be in Shandaril's Workbook.

Circle of Blindness
(Abjuration, Alteration)
Casting Time: 8
Duration: 3 turns
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell is used to delay and confuse enemies. Within the area of effect, the spell neutralizes normal and magically enhanced vision and hearing. It also suppresses the effects of the following spells: ESP, detect invisibility, detect evil/good, detect magic, locate object, seek, clairvoyance, infravision, wizard eye, and magics of similar e 1. The spell also renders useless any magical item that offers any sort of detection ability. It does not affect true seeing or find the path.
The circle is immobile and victims may blunder out of the area of effect. The only ways to end the spell before it wears off are wish spells of any sort, the dispel enchantment spell, or the intentional ending of the spell by the caster. All witches are immune to the effects of this spell.
Notes: Common for witches; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Circle of Flame
(Evocation)
(Fire)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a hollow ring of flames up to 10 feet across around the caster. The ring is stationary and does no damage to the caster or any of the caster's worn or carried items. The caster can pass through the ring repeatedly without harm. All other creatures suffer 2d6 points of damage from passing through any part of the ring, and 1d4 points of damage for each lesser contact. In other words, a charging creature that went straight through the circle would sustain 12 points of damage twice-once from each "wall" it encountered.
The circle of flames can be as high as the caster desires, to a maximum of 20 feet, but cannot be made to close at the top, into a sphere. The magic prevents the flames from burning any surface on top of which they appear (such as a door), but ceilings, flying creatures, and overhanging items are not protected.
The material components of this spell are a flint and a bit of ash from any fire.
Notes: Uncommon for Fire mages in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; otherwise rare. Virtually unknown elsewhere.

Clairaudience
(Divination)
Level: 3
Range: Unlimited
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
The clairaudience spell enables the wizard to concentrate upon some locale and hear in his mind any noise within a 60-foot radius of that point. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to the spellcaster or an obvious one (such as behind a door, around a corner, in a copse of trees, etc.), Only sounds that are normally detectable by the wizard can be heard by use of this spell. Lead sheeting or magical protections prevent the operation of the spell, and the wizard has some indication that the spell is so blocked. The spell creates an invisible sensor, similar to that created by a crystal ball spell, that can be dispelled; once placed, the sensor is immobile. The spell functions only on the wizard's current plane of existence.
The material component of the spell is a small horn of at least 100 gp value.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Clairvoyance
(Divination)
Level: 3
Components: V, S, M
Range: Unlimited
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Line of sight
Duration: 1 rd./level
Saving Throw: None
Similar to the clairaudience spell, the clairvoyance spell empowers the wizard to see in his mind whatever is within sight range from the spell locale chosen. Distance from the wizard is not a factor, but the locale must be known—familiar or obvious. Furthermore, light is a factor, as the spell does not enable the use of infravision or magical enhancements. If the area is magically dark, only darkness is seen; if naturally pitch dark, only a 10-foot radius from the center of the spell's area of effect can be seen. Otherwise, the seeing extends to the normal vision range according to the prevailing light. Lead sheeting or magical protection foils a clairvoyance spell, and the wizard has some indication that it is so blocked The spell creates an invisible sensor, similar to that created by a crystal ball spell, that can be dispelled; once placed, the sensor is immobile. The spell functions only on the wizard's current plane of existence.
The material component is a pinch of powdered pineal gland.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Claws of the Umber Hulk
(Alteration)
(Earth)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the subject's hands widen and his fingernails thicken and grow, becoming equivalent in size and power to the iron-like claws of an umber hulk. The transformation takes one full round and is excruciatingly painful, requiring a system shock roll. A failed roll causes the subject to suffer 3d4 points of damage.
The subject can burrow as an umber hulk, cutting through 10 feet of solid stone or 60 feet of soil per turn. The only limitation to this is the subject's stamina; at the end of each turn of burrowing, the subject must succeed a Constitution check or be forced to rest for one turn.
Burrowing through soil does not necessarily create a passable tunnel. If the subject wishes to make a passage in which others can travel or that he can exit when the spell ends, he must dig at a rate of 30 feet per turn. Cutting a tunnel through solid rock does not require extra care or time.
The recipient of this spell can make two claw attacks per round, each inflicting 2d6 points of damage plus any Strength bonuses. Each attack is made with a —2 penalty to hit. This penalty applies until the subject has made two successful consecutive attacks (not necessarily in the same round), at which time he is accustomed to using the claws. The penalty is dropped for the remainder of the spell.
The material component is an umber hulk's claw.
Notes: Uncommon spell (70M).

Cleanse Water
(Abjuration) (Province: Sea, Alchemy) ier
Reversible
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 20-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, a wizard can cleanse any poison, saltiness, unpleasant taste, or the like from a body of water. He renders it potable and refreshing, cool even in full desert sun. The spell can" remove alcohol (and dissolved drugs) from drinks, and turns magical potions into pure water At higher levels, a wizard can cleanse an entire oasis.
Only one body of liquid can be cleansed ata time, however. A "body" is either the maximum area of effect, or the water within a container or boundary, whichever is smaller. For example, if the spell purifies a bucket of well water, it has1 effect on the rest of the well.
Within a closed system, the results of this transformation are permanent; they don't end after any given duration. However, the spell does not prevent water from being polluted again in the future.
More poison can be added to a drink, for example. And a purified pool with an inlet that' polluted will soon be contaminated again. Ast general rule, if a body of water has an inlet thatis causing the pollution, the cleanliness lasts ld6 days (this includes oases and wells).
If the spell is cast on a body of water too large to be cleansed entirely, the surrounding water Soon taints the cleansed area again. For example, the wizard can cast the spell upon the ocean itself, creating a pure "pool" amidst the waves. In sucha case, the affected area returns to its original state in 5d4 turns. (The wizard might be better served by casting the spell upon a barrel of water.)
The reverse of this spell is pollute water. It fouls a body of water with a class H ingested poison (onset in 1 to 4 hours, inflicting 20 points of damage to the drinker, half that ifa successful Save vs. poison is made). Likewise, pollute water can transform a magical potion into a class H poison. The polluted fluid has an acrid, pungent, oily smell; easily detected by those who can smell such things. Other magics may conceal its deadly nature, however.
The effects of pollute water are as permanent asthose of its reverse. Small amounts of water ue permanently tainted, while those with an incoming flow of fresh water clear in 1d6 days. Water within another, larger body returns to normal in 5d4 turns.
The poisoning of wells in civilized areas is fegarded as treason throughout the cities and petty kingdoms of the Land of Fate. Those who engage in these activities are hunted down by the local authorities (or other adventurers).
The material component of both versions of this spell is a handful of sand, tainted with a drop ofthe caster's own blood. The wizard adds the fainted sand to the water he intends to alter. Casting either version drains 1d6 hit points from the wizard, which he can regain only through natural healing (not magical).
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise Very rare.

Cling — Drow
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster or another recipient to adhere to any surface, regardless of gravity, winds, weight, or slipperiness. This allows a slipping or leaping being who reaches a smooth stone, soapy, icy, or wet surface to stick fast.
The clinging being chooses a body area (e.g. back, hand, or the fingers of one hand) as the "holding" surface. As long as the holding surface doesn't move (that is, unlike a spider climb spell, the being cannot move about), the clinging effect remains firm, evenif the being casts spells, readies weapons, ties knots, drives in spikes, or performs another activity.
The cling spell ends instantly if the spell recipient moves about or if the surface clung to is shattered. If the recipient is struck by, or burdened by, an object of greater weight than its own, a Strength check is forced; failure also means that the cling spell fails. The caster can end the spell with a word. This spell does not lessen falling damage in any way.
Notes: Common for drow; otherwise very rare.

Cloak From Undead
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster or a single creature touched by the spellcaster is cloaked from undead in a similar manner to the priest spell invisibility to undead. The protected creature can take any nonhostile action and any undead nearby will ignore him. If the cloaked individual attacks an undead creature, only the undead is actually attacked notices the protected individual and is allowed to attack back. A cloaked priest or paladin cannot turn undead.
This spell is automatically effective against skeletons, zombies, ghouls, shadows, wights, ghasts, and other undead with 5 Hit Dice or fewer. Wraiths, mummies, spectres, and more powerful undead are allowed to make a saving throw vs. spell to see the cloaked individual. Vampires and undead creatures with 9 Hit Dice or more make this saving throw automatically. Creatures from other planes and creatures that are not undead are not affected by this spell.
The material components of the spell are a piece of bone and a pinch of powdered silver.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in the tome, Against the Undead.

Cloak of Adeamozs
(Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Areaof Effect: 1 being
Saving Throw: None
This spell partially protects the caster, or a single spell recipient being touched during casting, against damage inflicted spells of 3rd level or less and equivalent magical item discharges. It has no effect on saving throws or on spells that inflict no damage.
For spells that inflict random damage, a cloak of Adeamozs reduces their damage by 3 pointspet die for Ist-level spells, 2 points per die for 2nd-level spells, and 1 point per die for 3rd-level spells (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die). For spells that cause a set amount of damage or a certain base amount augmented by a number of points per level of the caster, a cloak of Adeamozs reduces the damage by 12 points for 1st-level spells, 8 points for 2nd-level spells, and 4 points for 3rd-level spells (to a minimum of 1 point).
The material components of this spell are a handful of iron filings from metal that was once part of a plate worn as body armor and a scrap of cobweb.
Notes: Uncommon or rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Cloak of Insanity — Drow
(Abjuration)
(Mentalism)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd. + 1d4 rds.
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell temporarily cloaks the caster's mind with wild, insane surface thoughts and images; it can't be read or influenced, even by psionics. A cloak of insanity therefore confers short-term immunity to psionic attack and all spells that act on the mind, such as charm, command, confusion, ESP. fear, feeblemind, phantasmal killer, possession, rulership, suggestion, and telepathy—and similar influencing or scrying effects created or caused by magical items. Limited wish and wish spells can penetrate this protection, as can the spells and spell-like powers wielded by demipowers and deities.
While protected, the caster can't cast another spell (this forces upon the caster instant feeblemind effects, lasting 1 turn/level of the caster). The caster can, with difficulty, use magical items (even those requiring command words, and/or mental control of effects), drink potions, scan spellbooks and scrolls to choose spells (but not study to memorize spells, or be feebleminded), or ready apparatus for later spellcasting. Combat and other physical activity, even if it causes unconsciousness or forces a system shock roll, cannot end this spell.
Each time this spell is used, there is a 12% chance that the caster will become confused (totally helpless) when it expires, this state lasting 2d4 rounds. If this occurs, roll 18; ifa result of 1-3 occurs, the caster will unleash an offensive spell (or failing that, hurl any available weapon) at a nearby creature, even if friendly (determine which creature randomly), and then revert to normal mental state.
Notes: Common to drow; otherwise very rare.

Cloak of Warding
{Abjuration)
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
The cloak of warding creates an invisible energy shield to absorb damage from all attacks against the caster. The cloak absorbs 34 points of damage plus 1 point per level of the caster. It can deflect damage from a single attack or from a number of successive attacks. The spell has a maximum duraof 1 round per level of the caster.
The cloak dissipates when its duration lapses or when it has absorbed all the damage it can.
Notes: Rare spell.

Cloak Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell renders undead creatures within its radius invisible both to the naked eye and to the detect undead spell. The undead remain invisible as long as they remain within 15 feet of the spell's center, If they move beyond that radius or attack in any fashion, they immediately become visible. The spell detect invisibility reveals their presence, as does true seeing and similar magics. The cloaking spell can be centered on the caster, on an object, or on a willing subject.
Undetected cloaked undead cannot be turned, though if a priest can detect them they can be turned in the normal fashion. Cloaked undead cannot enter areas normally protected from undead nor do they gain any other advantages.
Notes: Common for necromancers; uncommon for others. Known to be in the tome Studies in Death.

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 clone
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a duplicate of a human, demihuman, or humanoid creature. This clone is in most respects the duplicate of the individual, complete to the level of experience, memories, etc. However, the duplicate really is the person, so if the original and a duplicate exist at the same time, each knows of the other's existence; the original person and the clone will each desire to do away with the other, for such an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If one cannot destroy the other, one will go insane and destroy itself (90% likely to be the clone), or possibly both will become mad and destroy themselves (2% chance). These events nearly always occur within one week of the dual existence.
Note that the clone is the person as he existed at the time at which the flesh was taken for the spell component, and all subsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is totally unknown to the clone. The clone is a physical duplicate, and possessions of the original are another matter entirely. A clone takes 2d4 months to grow, and only after that time is dual existence established. Furthermore, the clone has one less Constitution point than the body it was cloned from; the cloning fails if the clone would have a Constitution of 0.
The material component of the spell is a small piece of the flesh from the person to be duplicated.
The DM may, in addition, add other stipulations to the success of a cloning effort, requiring that some trace of life must remain in the flesh sample, that some means of storing and preserving the sample must be devised and maintained, etc.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Clone Animal
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell is useful to check the result of experiments when using an opening the living spell. It will work on any creature of less than humanoid intelligence. The clone will have exactly the same traits, aspects, and defects as the original, The clone reaches the growth attained by the original during the casting time. This spell is not subject to dispel magic or similar effects once the casting time is completed, but the resulting creature must save vs. death magic each day after the casting or perish. The clone can be stabilized with a permanency spell, but in this case the caster has a 10% chance to permanently lose 1 point of Constition
The material component is 1 pint of blood per Hit Dice of creature to be cloned.
Notes: Very rare spell. (Updated from IMAGINE Magazine)

Close Path
(Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: 10 yds./level
Components V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 day
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: Neg.
This lesser magic closes a wizard's access to a path of magical knowledge that he could normally follow. This bars his access to one path (chosen randomly), for the remainder of the day, Spells already memorized are not forgotten; the wizard simply can't access them. The caster does not know which spell or spells are barred from the target (if any). After 24 hours pass, the wizard can memorize and cast spells of the closed path again normally. This spell cannot close off the principal school of a specialist wizard.
The material component of the close path spell is a small silver key worth at least 50 gp, which must be broken during the casting.
Notes: Common for Pathmasters; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Cloud Ladder
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 14 rds. + 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. length/level
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, the wu jen canmold and shape ordinary smoke into a misty ladder. The smoke must come from a fire of green wood. Reaching into the smoke, the wu jen casts the spell while shaping the ladder. Up to 10 feet of cloud ladder can be shaped per level of the caster.
The ladder weighs virtually nothing and one person can easily handle a cloud ladder of any length. Furthermore, the ladder is always steady and rigid, it need not be supported or leaned against an object. The wu jen simply places it in the desired position and climbs.
The ladder can be used only by the wu jen and one other creature per level of experience of the caster as designated by the wu jen. The ladder remains in place until the duration of the spell expires or until the wu jen wills it to vanish.
Before the end of the spell's duration, the wu jen has the option to cast an additional cloud ladder spell on a ladder previously created, maintaining its form for an additional duration.
The material component for the spell is a large fire of green wood.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Cloud Trapeze
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Caster + 1 creature/4 levels
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wu jen to soar on a magical cloud at incredible speeds. Upon casting the spell, the wu jen gently lifts into the air on a small cloud and then whizzes away in whatever direction he desires. The wu jen can take one mansized creature with him for every four levels he possesses.
The rate of movement is 10 miles every round—in a single turn, the wu jen can cover 100 miles! Those riding on the cloud feel none of the effects of this swift movement and the nde is perfectly steady and calm, even through the worst weather. At the end of the spell or when the wu jen decides to land, the cloud settles gently to earth and disappears.
The material component for this spell is a ball of cotton.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Cloudburst
(Alteration)
(Air, Water)
Level: 3
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd./5 levels.
Area of Effect: 30-ft. diameter cylinder
up to 60-ft. high
Saving Throw: None
This spell immediately precipitates all moisture in the air into a drenching rain that falls at 1 inch per round. The cloudburst quenches normal fires (small ones immediately, medium sized ones in half a round, and large ones in full round), and douses magical fires for 1d2 rounds. Largearea fire spells are extinguished in a huge cloud of steam. Fog will be precipitated as rain, while smoke and similar clouds of particles will be dispersed.
A cloudburst spell may be affected by climate and temperature of the area (greater effect in jungles, lesser in deserts, sleet/snow in arctic, etc.).
The material components are a small kite and some rock salt.
Notes: Common for Air mages, Water mages, Weather mages, and the like; otherwise uncommon.

Cloudkill
(Evocation)
(Air, Alchemy)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 40 x 20 x 20-ft. cloud
Saving Throw: None
This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4+1 Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4+1 to 5+1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poison with —4 penalties or be slain, and creatures with up to 6 Hit Dice (inclusive) to roll unmodified saving throws vs. poison or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.
The cloudkill moves away from the spellcaster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast under water.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Cold Curtain — Dragon
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 doorway or portal
Saving Throw: Neg.
This is another warding spell quite similar to door of death. Using this spell, the draconic caster can ward a particular doorway or portal so that any creature who tries to pass through the portal without first speaking a word of command is immediately the subject to a modified form of energy drain. A portal protected by a cold curtain spell radiates a strong aura of necromantic magic, and the warded area has a temperature some 20° F. lower than the area outside the curtain, (Here the word "portal" can also refer to a caye opening or tunnel no more than 30 feet in diameter.) The portal so warded must be the only entrance into a room or chamber no larger than volume of 8,000 cubic feet (a cubic room 20 feet on a side, for example).
A single application of this spell can drain up to 30 Hit Dice or levels of creatures before becoming inert. Each creature passing through the portal rolls a saving throw vs. wands with a —2 penalty; a successful saving throw means that the creature is unaffected.
A failed saving throw means that the creature is subject to the full effect of the cold curtain spell. As soon as the creature passes through the portal, it loses one level or Hit Die (as if struck by a wight). A monster loses 1 Hit Die permanently, suffering losses in both hit points and attack ability. A character loses a level, a Hit Die, hit points, and abilities permanently (until regained through adventuring, if applicable),
At the end of each round that a creature remains within the area warded by the cold curfain, it loses another level or Hit Die (no saving throw against these subsequent losses). This loss continues each round until the creature steps back through the curtain outside the warded area. (This passage from inside to outside doesn't cause another level loss.)
The curtain can affect any number of creatures simultaneously. When it has drained a total of 30 Hit Dice or levels, the spell terminates.
Note that only the doorway or portal itself is warded. An individual could conceivably smash through or otherwise penetrate the wall next to the door and enter safely.
While casting the spell, the dragon can choose whether or not the warding is to be visible. If the dragon chooses visibility, the portal is covered by a faintly shimmering blue glow that is totally transparent; this glow isn't bright enough to be seen in full daylight, but it is obvious under twilight or darker conditions.
Notes: Restricted to dragons; uncommon. Known to be in the Draconomicon.

Collapse Portal
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: 20 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius/level
Saving Throw: Special
This rare magic can seal the crystal sphere in which a fantasy world floats. The spell is unreliable; the caster must make an Intelligence check to avoid failure. Ifa create portal spell was cast during the past turn within a 1-mile radius, the check is made at a 3-point penalty.
If the check succeeds, the crystal sphere seals. If the two-round casting time brings a ship to the sphere's shell as spelicasting is completed, roll a d10 to determine just when the sphere closes (see table).

1d10	Result
1-2	Portal closes before the ship reaches the sphere; ship must turn or ram the shell.
3-5	Portal closes as the ship reaches the sphere; ship unavoidably rams the shell.
6-9	Portal closes on the ship, cutting it cleanly into two pieces.
0	Portal closes just after ship passes through.

A ship ramming or being cut by a crystal sphere sustains both collision damage and spelljammer shock (the he/msman must save vs. spell or die).
A ramming ship suffers loses 10 hull points (a ship with 0 hull points breaks up). The ship rings with the impact, and all those not sitting or firmly tied down have a chance to lose their balance and fall. Those with Dexterity scores must make a Dexterity check of fall prone, while those without have a flat 40% chance to fall.
A bisected ship also breaks up immediately, its atmosphere dividing between the two parts of the ship. Decide randomly where the break occurs. All beings at risk should save vs. death magic at +3 to avoid being slain by the closing shell, and any items at risk must save vs. disintegration to avoid destruction.
Few know how to cast this spell, though almost every spacefaring being has heard dark tales of it cutting ships in half as a crystal sphere closes.
The material components are two smooth stones of any size, one of diamond and the other of obsidian.
Notes: Rare in spelljamming cultures; otherwise unknown.

Color
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: Special
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 8 square yds.
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a wizard to effect a permanent color change in cloth, leather, or similar substances. The speed at which the change takes place is variable. With a gesture, the caster can instantaneously make an entire piece change to a single hue. If several colors are desired the caster must trace with his fingers the areas he intends to color and picture the desired hue for the area outlined; the color changes accordingly Any coloror shade can be created, including metallic tints, though the latter cannot actually consist of pre cious metals. Any color changes must be done within two hours, the spell's maximum casting: time. The effect is permanent until dispelled.
Notes: Rare spell. Known to be in Myrls Text.

Color Blindness
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Range: 1 yd.
Components: V
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 3 turns
Area of Effect' 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The color blindness spell makes recipient unable to distinguish colors. All vision is in black and white. If the creature fails its initial saving throw vs. spell, only a successful dispel magicor dispel illusion can remove the defect before the spell's expiration; the various cure spells cannot remove this effect.
The negative effects of this spell are moderated. by the DM. Many gems, beasts, potions, banners, plants, and so on are distinguished by color,a being who is colorblind cannot use color to distinguish between them.
The positive effects of color blindness include a +2 (or +10%) bonus in locating camouflaged objects, and a —2 (or —10%) penalty assessed against persons hiding in shadows from the color blind individual. Thus, brownies (invisible in nat ural surroundings) can be seen on a 10% chance, while shadows are only 80% undetectable.
The colorblind individual has a +1 bonus to his surprise roll if opponents are camouflaged or hiding in shadows.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in the Cyclopedia Phantastica Vol.III. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Color Spray
(Alteration)
Level: f
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 5 x 20 ft. wedge, 20-ft. long
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from his hand. These make a triangular plane, 5 feet wide at the caster's end opening to 20 feet wide at the far end, which ends 20 feet from the caster.
From one to six creatures (1d6) within the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard. All creatures above the level of the spellcaster and all those of 6th level or 6 Hit Dice or more are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Blind or unseeing creatures are not affected by the spell.
Creatures not allowed or failing saving throws, and whose Hit Dice or levels are less than or equal to the spellcaster's level, are struck unconscious for 244 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 1 or 2 greater than the wizard's level are blinded for 1d4 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 3 or more greater than that of the spellcaster are stunned (reeling and unable to think or act coherently) for one round.
The material components of this spell are a pinch each of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Combine
(Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: Up to 1 turn
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
Combine allows the caster to meld two other currently memorized spells together, so that they can be cast simultaneously with joined effects. The two spells cannot exceed more than seven total spell levels, so a 3rd- and 4th-level spell could be combined, or a Sth- and 2nd-level spell, orany other combination that falls within these limits. The spells remain linked in the caster's mind for up to one full turn. If the combined form is not cast in this time, the linked spells automatically dissociate from each other, and the combine spell is wasted.
When the paired spells are actually cast, the most restrictive casting time, range, area of effect, etc., are used. For example, if enervation and slow are combined, the joint spell would only affecta single creature, because enervation only strikes one target. The casting time would be 4 and the range would be 10 yards/level due to enervation's characteristics, but the duration would be based on s/ow and would only be 3 rounds plus 1 round/level.
The material component is a small pair of golden rings.
Notes: Common for witches; otherwise very rare. (Updated from Dr4Gon Magazine)

The DM might decide to let certain appropriate spell combinations—for instance, shout and gust of wind, or Melf's acid arrow joined and flame arrow—function as the most favorable spell instead of the least favorable. In such cases, the DM will have to decide on the exact effects of the combined spells; joining ice stormto fireballis somewhat counterproductive.
One possibility is to let a wizard researcha special variant of the combine spell that works with a particular combination.
Another is to let a wild mage have a 2% chance per combination of discovering a lucky match-up in those cases the DM decides there is a chance for one.

Combust —Red Wizard
(Evocation)
(Fire)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 30 Ibs./level
Saving Throw: 4
This spell makes a combustible object burst into flame, even it damp. The damage done to those wearing, carrying, riding in, or otherwise in contact with the object is 1d6 per 30 Ibs. weight base damage; save vs. paralysis for half damage.
Thereafter fire inflicts 1d6 points of damage perturn per level of the caster until the object is consumed or the flame is extinguished. The flame itself is not magical, merely hot. While this spell cannot be directly cast on creatures, it can be cast upon any flammable clothing or equipment, provided the caster can make a successful touch attack.
Notes: Common for the Red Wizards of Thay; otherwise rare.

Comfort
(Abjuration)
(Song)
Level: 3
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 6 hrs.
Area of Effect: Up to 10 creatures
Saving Throw: None
Recipients of the benefit of this spell feel no pain, heat, cold, hunger, thirst, or exhaustion, and need not eat or rest for the duration of the spell. The spell does not negate normal damage taken, but, for example, negates the effects of a wand of fear, drums of panic, any similar magical item, or asleep spell. Recipients receive a +1 to all saving throws for the duration of the spell.
Notes: Common to witches, song mages, and bards; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Command Dragon
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: 10 mi/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3 turns
Duration: 4 hrs./level
Area of Effect: 1 dragon
Saving Throw: None
This very rare spell requires the caster to have collected the shards of the egg from which the dragon to be commanded was hatched. When the spell is cast, the dragon affected is forced come to the caster and obey his commands, provided these are along the guidelines of suggestion spell: they must sound reasonable and not be obviously harmful to the dragon. A demand for the dragon to plunge into a pit of acid is clearly unreasonable, while the suggestion that a freshly encountered pool of acid is actually water and that a fresh dip would be refreshing is another matter.
The caster and the dragon can communicate by way of a telepathic link as long as they stay within the spell's range. The wizard need not know the dragon's language to be understood. The mind-link does not allow him to see, hear, or smell what the dragon can, but he can ask the dragon to describe what it senses, and it is compelled to answer his questions truthfully.
The dragon cannot knowingly cause harm to the caster while the spell is in effect, nor is it likely to knowingly let the caster come to harm. Acts or suggestions by the caster that violate the guidelines of the spell allow the dragon to make a saving throw vs. spell in order to throw off the spell entirely. It need not obey the offending command in any event.
Should the dragon be released from the spell because of the caster's commands, it is free to teach the caster a brief and fatal lesson about the consequences of controlling dragons. If the spell has elapsed normally and the wizard has used it fairly, the dragon will depart.
This spell was created by an elf mage too near the close of the Second Dragon War to be used to major effect in that conflict.
The material component of the spell is a complete and set of shards of the egg from which the particular dragon was hatched; if even one shard is missing, the spell has no effect. The egg's shards are destroyed in the casting, so that the spell can be used only once per dragon.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Command Element
(Alteration)
(Province: Flame, Sand, Sea, Wind)
Level: 7 dy
Range: 10 ft,/level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1,000 cu. ft/level
Saving Throw: None
Each elemental requires a separate version of this spell, and each must be specifically memonized
This spell forces the elements themselves to do the caster's bidding. Rocks will part or rise, flame lower and die, river waters creep onto shore winds fill a ship's sails. However, this spell does not empower the caster to make direct attacks with these elements.
The elemental material can be moved, parted, or sculpted. Wind patterns can be chan gases scattered, mines ventilated, and in created. Ores can be separated, doors carvet tunnels, ditches, and dikes created. Salt cam! removed from fresh water, fields irrigated, lowered. Fires can be lowered, started, or senti new directions. None of these actions can dires affect creatures in the area of affect.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; for Elementalist wizards; otherwise very rare.

Command Elementals — Old Empire
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: 40 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell enables the caster to command (or wrest command of) a single creature from one of the elemental or para-elemental planes.
The target is permitted a saving throw, but elementals of low intelligence or lower suffer at 4 penalty to the roll. If the saving throw is failed, the wizard can maintain his control over the elemental for the duration of the spell, overriding all other controls on that elemental, including other command elemental spells.
Notes: Comon for Elementalist wizards, rare for conjurers; otherwise very rare. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Command Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 hr. + 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wizard to command undead creatures exactly as an evil priest of the same level. The caster can control the same the number and type, and requires the same roll on the Turn Undead table, The wizard is allowed only one command check per encounter during the spell's duration; if it succeeds, he controls 26 undead, but if the command attempt fails he cannot try again.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Command Water Spirits
(Evocation) Q é
(Province: Sea)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Despite its name, this spell commands no true spirits. It merely influences currents in the sea and other large bodies of water, enabling the caster to move objects on and under the surface. Results are impressive, leading many to believe they're the work of spirits.
The caster can move any ship fully within range, up to its base move per hour, even in becalmed or adverse wind conditions. (See notes on ocean voyaging in Chapter 14 of the DMG.) The currents also can slow a ship within range of this spell, reducing its movement by half. The slowed ship incurs no other penalties, and the condition lasts until the spellcaster moves out of range.
In addition, the caster can move floating objects or creatures up to 60 feet per round along the surface. If an object is beneath the surface, the caster can move up to 20 pounds per level, at a maximum rate of 30 feet per round. In this fashion, he can raise an object from the seafloor and bring it to the surface. Finally, the currents can be manipulated into a strong undertow, dangerous to swimmers. To avoid being dragged under, a swimmer must make a Strength check with a —2 penalty, or a swimming proficiency check. If he fails, the swimmer then must make another Strength check each round thereafter to break free. (See "Holding Your Breath" in Chapter 14 of the Player's Handbook.)
The material component of this spell is a clear glass, into which some water from the sea or lake is poured. The glass shatters at the end of the spell's duration. Breaking or emptying the glass will end the spell prematurely.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Commune With Greater Spirit
(Divination)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components. V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is identical to the Sth-level shukenja spell of the same name, and similar to the commune with lesser spirit spell. The points of difference are that any type of spirit, including divine powers, can be contacted by this spell.
A typical greater spirit is the spirit of a mountain or a river. To contact the spirit, the wu jen must know its identity (which can be obtained through a trance spell) and the caster must be within 10 feet of the area where the spirit is found.
Once the spirit is contacted, the wu jen can ask one question per experience level of the caster. Questions must be specific and clearly worded, and are limited to yes or no answers (although "maybe" and "I don't know" are also acceptable replies).
The spirit answers questions literally and does not volunteer any information. The answers are always correct If the answer is known. Good spirits attempt to be as helpful as possible within the limits of the question, neutral spirits answer in riddling or roundabout ways, and evil spirits always try to distort the answer based on the wording of the question.
The spirit can answer only those questions concerning the immediate area it affects. Questions beyond the scope of the spirit are wasted. Thus, the spirit of a great tree in the village could not answer questions about events outside the village, and a ghost haunting a temple could not discuss events not related to the temple or its reasons for haunting it. The DM decides if a question is within the realm of the spirit.
The DM can limit the use of this spell to once a week (or even less) for any particular spirit, since they do not care to be disturbed by the trifling affairs of the material world.
The material component for this spell is an offering of appropriate type and value to the spirit contacted.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Commune with Lesser Spirit
(Divination)
Level: 3
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is identical to the 2nd-level shukenja spell of the same name. By use of the commune with lesser spirit spell, the wu jen is able to contact any of the hundreds of local spirits that dwell in the land. Local spirits are those with limited range and power; typical lesser spirits are those of a particular tree, rock, or stream. A spirit that haunts a single building or compound could also be contacted. The spirit of a mountain or river is greater than a lesser spirit and is beyond the power of this spell.
To contact the spirit, the wu jen must knowits identity (which can be obtained through a trance spell) and must be within 10 feet of the area where the spirit is found.
Once the spirit is contacted, the wu jen can ask it one question per level of experience. The questions must be specific and clearly worded, but are not limited to yes or no answers. The spirit answers questions literally and does not volunteer any information. The answers are always correct if the answer is known. Good spirits attempt to be as helpful as possible within the limits of the question, neutral spirits answer in riddling or roundabout ways, and evil spirits always try to distort the answer based on the wording of the question.
The spirit can answer only those questions concerning the immediate area it affects. Questions beyond the scope of the spirit are wasted. Thus, the spirit of a great tree in the village could not answer questions about events outside the village, and a ghost haunting a temple could not discuss events not related to the temple or its reasons for haunting it. The DM must decide if any question is within the realm of the local spirit. The DM can, if he chooses, limit the use of this spell to once a week (or even less) for any particular spirit, since they do not care to be disturbed by the trifling affairs of the material world.
The material components of this spell are incense and an offering appropriate to the nature of the spirit.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Compass
(Evocation)
(Artifice)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 7 days + 1 day/level
Area of Effect; Special
Saving Throw: None
The spell requires is a brass bowl filled with water, with a circle of cork set afloat in it. Atop the cork is affixed a long iron pin or needle, painted red on the pointing end. When the spell is cast, the cork stays centered in the bowl and rotates until the pointer aims in the direction defined by the caster.
This pointer always points in a direction defined by the caster. This is often a map direction, but it can be more abstract: the compass may always point to their home port, or their destination, for example. The caster can choose only a familiar direction, such as a place he has seen or a direction of which he is certain.
In calm weather the compass is easy to read, but in rough waters the float bobs about enough that reading properly the compass requires a successful Intelligence ability check; if the check fails, the reading is off by 20° to 180°, If all the water is drained from the bowl or the cork is removed, the spell is broken. For this reason, the compass often is covered with glass to keep water and float in place.
Notes: Very rare spell. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine)

Compose Mind
(Abjuration)
(Mentalism)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Max. 3 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This deceptively simple spell imbues the caster's mind with a supernatural calm, allowing the logical analysis of battle situations without fear or distraction from spells, injuries, and other sources. However, compose mind does not grant the caster the ability to cast spells without interruption in the face of injury or significant distraction.
When the spell is in effect, the caster cannot be distracted by the following conditions:
* The pain of wounds and injuries.
* Natural fears and phobias.
* Itching, irritation, dizziness, confusion, and disorientation, whether normal or magically induced, including the spells irritation, confusion, and chaos.
* Any Ist- or 2nd-level spell that affects emotions, such as Tasha 's uncontrollable hideous laughter or scare.

Additionally, the caster gains a +2 bonus to any saving throws allowed against these effects:
+ All emotion-affecting spells of 3rd level an higher, including emotion, fear, or symbol,
* All Ist- and 2nd-level spells that create illusions.
* Natural awe, fascination, or fear effects of a powerful monsters and beings.

The spell lasts 3 rounds per caster level or until the caster misses a saving throw against an emotion-affecting spell or power.
The material component is a stick of incense, which is burned while the spell is in effect.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in the Lakharemtolma Zalarem, aka Zalas Book of Barriers. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Comprehend Languages
(Alteration)
(Universal)
Reversible
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 speaking creature or written text
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to understand the spoken words of a creature or read an otherwise incomprehensible written message (such as writing in another language). In either case, the wizard must touch the creature or the writing, Note that the ability to read does not necassarily impart understanding of the material, nor does the spell enable the caster to speak or write an unknown language. Written material can be read at the rate of one page or equivalent per round. Magical writing cannot be read, other than to know it is magical, but the spell is often useful when deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (the 3rd-level secret page and illusionary script spells), and it does not reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.
The material components of this spell are a pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.
The reverse of this spell, confuse languages, cancels a comprehend languages spell or renders a writing or a creature's speech incomprehensible, for the same duration as above.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Conceal Temporal Anomaly
(Chronomancy)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1d4 turns
Duration: Permanent
Areaof Effect: 1 anomaly
Saving Throw: None
The caster splits the flow of time around a temporal disturbance. This reduces the turbulence it causes and shields it from magical detection. A detect temporal anomaly spell (or an item with the same effect) has a chance to detect the hidden effect, but the base chance is lowered to 25%. Other detection spells (true seeing, detect invisibility, and so on) also have a 25% chance to detect the anomaly, but those uninitiated in the mysteries of chronomancy are unlikely to know what it is they are seeing.
Vortices can be hidden in this way, but the forces involved become extremely hazardous. A chronomancer must check against Wisdom at -4. Failure destroys the vortex, ages the caster 1d20 years, and reduces the caster's Wisdom permanently by 1 point.
The material component is a glass bulb filled with the blood of a vortex spider. This spell cannot be used cumulatively with itself.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Conduit — Elf
(Enchantment, Invocation)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Up to 5 missiles
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, the caster can temporarily enchant up to five missiles (typically arrows) with spells of 4th level or less. The conduit spell thus allows the caster to extend the range of a spell by the range of the missile weapon. Unless otherwise specified when the spell is cast, the effects of the spell radiate forward from the point the arrowhead strikes. The casting time for the conduit spell does not include the casting times of the spells loaded into the missiles, which are additional.
At least one missile affected by this spell must be fired within one turn after the last is enchanted, and no missile will hold its spell for longer than an hour.
Each missile receives its own spell; all spells emplaced with a conduit spell must be those that the caster has memorized for the day. For example, a sorceress who has memorized but a single fireball can place a fireball on only one of het arrows.
An enchanted missile releases its spell when the head of the missile strikes something, whether that be the target, the ground, a tree, a rock, or whatever. This means a spell with a radius, such as afireball, is often more effective than a spell such as burning hands or shocking grasp.
Targets are allowed normal saving throws against these spells, as if the mage hadcast the spell. However, if the missile carries the spell beyond the spell's normal casting range, the mage has no more control over the spell.
For example, the web and dimension door spells require the caster to manipulate the spell, and the caster cannot do so unless the missile strikes within the caster's range with the spell. Unless the mage carefully calculates the desired effect, these spells usually won't work (the range for a 9th-level caster to cast a web spell is 45 yards; if shot to a range of 60 yards, the caster can't control where the web should attach itself, so the spell effect collapses).
The attack roll needed to hit an area (for purposes of this spell) is a successful attack roll against Armor Class 6; range modifiers will adjust this.
The material component ts a copper wire twisted into the shape of an arrow.
Notes: Restricted to elves, who guard it jealously; uncommon. Found mostly in the hands of fighter/mages.

Cone of Cold
(Evocation)
(Water)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 4
When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of extreme cold, originating at the wizards hand and extending outward in a cone 5 feet long and 1 foot in diameter per level of the caster. It drains heat and causes 1d4+1 points of damage per level of experience of the wizard, to a maximum of 10d4+10. For example, an 8th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold 8feet in diameter at the far end and 40 feet long, causing 8d4+8 points of damage.
The material component is a crystal or glass cone of very small size.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Confer
(Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell is cast (often by a lich) in conjunction with create minion for the purpose of creatinga "quasimancer" (that is, a minion with spellcasting ability), When the confer spell is cast upon the created minion, the undead creature's mind becomes attuned to spell memorization. The caster can then plant the spell repertoire of a 5th-level wizard (including number of spells and levels) within the minion's mind.
The quasimancer can then cast the implanted spells at its discretion, as if it were the wizard who memonized them. The quasimancer must have all spell components necessary to cast the spells implanted in its mind.
The caster must imbue spell energy equal to the level of the spell placed in the quasimancer's head. In other words, to place a Sth-level spell in the quasimancer, the caster must imbue a Sthlevel spell from his daily allowance of carried magic. The quasimancer can receive spells from its master only once; when all of its spells are cast, it becomes a mindless undead.
This spell cannot be cast upon any other creature than one raised by a create minion spell. Casting it upon a living person will instantly cause insanity that can be cured only by psychic surgery or a wish
The material components of this spell are the minion and a bit of brain tissue from a sapient being. (More details are provided in Van Richten's Guide to the Lich, Chapter VII.)
Notes: Very rare. This spell can be learned only on its plane of origin (the Demiplane of Dread).

Conflagration
(Evocation, Necromancy)
(Province: Flame)
Level: 9
Range: 20 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: 1 rd./level of caster
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This gruesome spell sets a living creature on fire, incinerating its hair, clothing, and at least the top layer of flesh. The target suffers 2d6 points of damage each round, with no saving throw allowed. Individuals within 10 feet of the target are allowed a saving throw vs. spells. A failure means the individual suffers 26 hit points damage; success means the damage is halved.
All items carried by the target must make a saving throw vs. magical fire at -2 or be destroyed These flames are so intense that they set ablaze all other flammable items within 10 feet of the target and melt soft metals, if such items fail a saving throw vs. magical fire. The spell creates an "extremely hot flame" as far as devices such as a ring of fire resistance are concerned.
The living target of the conflagration can move and fight normally as long as he lives, and all those within 10 feet are subject to fire damage. He cannot cast spells, but can still use spell-like abilities.
Death brings no relief. When all hit points are lost, the target's corpse falls under the control of the caster. The wizard can animate his now-dead target by mental command, but cannot perform other spells in addition to commanding this movement.
Conflagration is difficult to thwart. Spraying the target with water or sand only creates a billowing cloud of steam or hot dust within 20 feet of the target, causing 1 d6 points of additional damage to those within the cloud. Complete immersion in a large amount of water, or burial beneath the sand, reduces damage to 1 point per round for both the target and those within 10 feet. A well or reflecting pool does not contain enough water for this task, but a small lake does. A successful dispel magic spell also puts out the fire.
The material component of this spell is a wax doll.
Notes: Common in an arabian setting; otherwise very rare.

Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Mentalism)
Level: 4
Range: 120 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 2 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Up to 60-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes confusion in one or more
creatures within the area, creating indecision and
the inability to take effective action. The spell
affects 1d4 creatures, plus one creature per caster
level. These creatures are allowed saving throws
vs. spell with —2 penalties, adjusted for Wisdom.
Those successfully saving are unaffected by the
spell. Confused creatures react as follows:

D10	Roll Action
1	Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell
2-6	Stand confused for one round (then roll again)
7-9	Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again)
10	Act normally for one round(then roll again)

The spell lasts for two rounds plus one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the "wander away. for the duration of the spell" result occurs.
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (humans walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.
If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to make the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused, and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the ores
are not near the party, the DM decides that two attacking the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stand confused, four attack, and one acts normally.
The material component is a set of three nut shells.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Conjure Animals
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 6
Range: Special
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 30-yd. radius
Saving Throw: None
The conjure animals spell enables the wizard to magically create one or more mammals to attack his opponents. The total Hit Dice of the mammals cannot exceed twice his level, if determined randomly, or his level ifa specific animal type is requested (see the DUNGEON MASTER Guide). Thus, a wizard of 12th level could randomly conjure two mammals with 12 Hit Dice, four with 6 Hit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit Dice each, twelve with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every +1 hit point bonus of a creature as 1/4 of a Hit Die; thus, a creature with 4+3 Hit Dice equals a 4 3/4 Hit Dice creature. The conjured animal(s) remain for one round for each level of the conjuring wizard, or until slain. They follow the caster's verbal commands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack the wizard's opponents, but they resist being used for any other purpose.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Conjure Cabinet — Bard
(Conjuration)
Level:4
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This is a very special spell castable only by the bard class. Before this spell can be used, the bard must have a special cabinet made. It must be of the highest quality, worth at least 1,000 gp. It can beany size up to 4 feet wide by 4 feet deep by 8 feet high.
Once the cabinet is made, this spell must be cast upon it and the cabinet must be named. At any later date, the bard can cast this spell and the cabinet temporarily teleports to the bard's current location. The cabinet carries with it any contents that are of a performing nature usable by the bard. (For example, it might contain musical instruments, cleaning tools, a playing stool, etc. for a True Bard. It might be lined with throwing daggers, rapiers [for sword swallowing], and blindfolds for a Blade).
When the cabinet teleports to the bard, a percentile die must be rolled. On a roll of 01-04, it appears 2d20 feet in the air and falls, destroying itself (but its contents are recoverable). On a roll of 99-00, it teleports into the ground and is destroyed. Otherwise, it is safe.
The cabinet remains for the duration of the spell or until the bard speaks the cabinet's name. It then teleports safely back to its previous location, along with any carried items of a performing nature usable by the bard. A bard can have only one such cabinet at a time. The teleport will not carry the cabinet to another plane. If items of anonperforming nature are left in the cabinet, then the cabinet will not teleport.
Notes: Restricted to bards; uncommon.

Conjure Dream Object
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level:4
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time:
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 small object
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, an object up to the size ofa sword appears where the caster directs, within the spell's range. The object can be anything that the caster has seen in someone else's dream (by means of the enter dream spell). Thus, the spellcaster can conjure the long lost sword of a warrior's grandmother, the trothing cup imagined in the dreams of a young woman, or simply a fabulous ruby dreamed by a greedy met
The conjured object is real in all respects, but it never has magical properties, even if it has such properties in the dreams from which it is drawn. At the end of the spell's duration, the object returns to the realm of dreams, from which it can be conjured again.
The material components of this spell are a strip of dreamwillow bark and a bit of matter of me type the caster wishes to summon (a of steel for a sword, a fragment of glass for a goblet, etc.)
Notes: Uncommon for Dream mages; otherwise very rare. (Updated from Dr4Gon Magazine.)

Conjure Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Geometry)
Level: 5
Range: 60 yds
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Summons 1 elemental
Saving Throw: None
There are actually four spells in the conjure elemental spell. The wizard is able to conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental with this spell—assuming he has the material component for the particular elemental. (A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure a fire elemental; a large amount of water must be availableto conjure a water elemental.) Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.
It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. Each type of elemental can be conjured only once per day.
The conjured elemental must be controlledby the wizard—the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands—or it tums on the wizard and attacks. The elemental will not break offa combat to do so, but it will avoid crea tures while secking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of © concentration, This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. An ele mental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell's duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water.
The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small it of one of the following:

Air Elemental: Burning incense
Earth Elemental: Soft clay
Fire Elemental: Sulphur and phosphorus
Water Elemental: Water and sand

Special protection from uncontrolled elemenisavailable by means of a protection from evil
Motes: Common spell (PHB).

Conjure Elemental-Kin
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Geometry)
Level: 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Summons 1 elemental-kin
Saving Throw: None
Like the conjure elemental spell, this summoning can be used to summon a creature from one of the four elemental planes—a sylph from the plane of Air, a pech or sandling from the plane of Earth, a fire snake from the plane of Fire, or a nereid or water weird from the plane of Water. The wizard must decide which elemental-kin he will conjure when he memorizes the spell since the components and procedures are different for tach. An elemental specialist can conjure only from his element.
Elemental-kin can be conjured onlyif there is a good amount of their native element at hand; a good-sized fire or a body of water is required for those elemental-kin. In addition to this and either ‘naquamarine (air), amber (earth), ruby (fire), or emerald (water) gem worth 1,500 gp, the wizard must also provide the spell's material component, which varies by element:

Air Elemental-kin: Burning incense
Earth Elemental-kin: Soft clay
Fire Elemental-kin: Sulphur and phosphorus
Water Elemental-kin: Water and sand

The elemental-kin is bound to obey the wizard's commands and will not turn against him, but it is generally annoyed by its summoning and cooperates only as instructed. Given the chance, the creature will disappear and return to its home in the elemental planes; in order to prevent this, the wizard must concentrate on keeping the creature from leaving. (If the wizard is wounded or grappled, or casts another spell, his concentration is broken.) The elemental-kin can be controlled or maintained at a distance of 30 yards per caster level.
The various elemental-kin creatures are described in detail in the Monstkous MANUAL tome, under the heading "Elemental." At the DM's option, other elemental creatures of 4 Hit Dice or less can be summoned with this spell.
Notes: Common for conjurers, geometers, and Air, Earth, Fire, and Water mages; otherwise uncommon (PO:SM).

Conjure Greater Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Air, Earth, Fire, Water)
Reversible
Level: 7
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Summons 1 greater elemental
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to summon a single greater elemental from an elemental plane. The conjure greater elemental spell is actually four spells, each of which must be learned separately. The wizard can conjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemental with this spell—assuming he has the proper version memorized and material component for the particular elemental. The power of the conjured greater elemental depends on the level of the caster. Only one greater elemental can be conjured in a day.
Greater elementals are both more powerful and more intelligent than than the common elementals summoned by lesser spells. While they can be forced to serve in the same manner as lesser elements, a conjured greater elemental can be bargained with, if the caster can show how its actions will further Elemental Plane concerns. The caster must offer suitable inducements, or the greater elemental is 10% likely to depart to its home plane.
The material component of the spell (besides a great the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:

Air Elemental: Burning incense
Earth Elemental: Soft clay
Fire Elemental: Sulphur and phosphorus
Water Elemental: Water and sand

Special protection from elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell.
Elemental specialists are restricted to elementals of their own element, but have a +1 Reaction roll advantage when negotiating with them.

Caster Level	Elemental Hit Dice	Weapon to Hit
14		12			+2
18		16			42
24+		21			+2

* Any casting is 5% likely to summon the next more powerful elemental. The greater elemental is 1% likely per Hit Die to be free-willed. A 24thlevel caster will summon a greater elemental of demipower status, at least 24 Hit Dice and immune to weapons of less than +3 enchantment.

Free-willed elementals of these power levels can be negotiated with, but tend to be more hostile and less tractable. Spells such as exaction and oathbinding might be useful.
Notes: Common for Elemental mages, otherwise uncommon.

Conjure Greater Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Reversible
Level: 7
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to summon a single greater elemental from any elemental plane. The Hit Dice of the elemental are determined randomly.
This spell is otherwise identical to the sixthlevel wizard spell, conjure elemental. The greater elementals of Athas are described in the MONSTROUS COMPEDIUM DARK SUN Appendix, Terrors Of the Desert.

Roll	Hit Dice
01-65	10
66-90	14
91-00	18
Notes: Common on Athas; otherwise very rare.

Conjure Nightmare
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Shadow)
Level: 5
Range: 50 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 hr. + 4d6 turns
Area of Effect: Summons 1 nightmare
Saving Throw: None
The caster of this spell summons a mount, nightmare (see the Monstrous MANUAL tome) from the Plane of Dreams, as it carries a dreamer on its terrible ride. Thus, the summoned nightmare is always frustrated at losing its dreaming subject, and it requires an immediate offering from its summoner (see the material components).
The nightmare serves its summoner willingly, as long as the tasks it is given are evil. It can understand the summoner's commands evenif he is not evil, but it may feel that somethingis wrong if its caster is good. If ordered to perform tasks without an obvious wicked purpose, the nightmare rebels at the first opportunity.
Because the nightmare is summoned from dream rather than from a lower plane, it remains only until the dreamer it haunted awakes. The spell grants no control over the source of the summoned nightmare, so the caster cannot, for instance, cast eternal slumber on a subject, cast true nightmare, and then cast summon nightmare with the expectation of a permanent servitor.
The material components include apinch of ground sulphur, crushed bark of the dreamwillow, and a handful of flaked platinum worth no less than 200 gp.
Notes: Uncommon for shadow mages and Dream mages; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Nightmare: AL NE; AC -4; MV 15, Fl 36 (C); THAC0 13; #AT 3; Dmg 1d6+4/1d6+4/2d4; SA burning hooves; SD noxious cloud, 10' r., save vs. paralysis or -2 to attack and damage for 2d4 rounds; SZ L; ML Elite (13-14).

Conjure Sand Lion
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Province: Sand)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds.
Components. V,S,M
Casting Time:
Duration: Id4 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
A wizard conjures a faithful female spotted lion when this spell is cast.
The sand lion roars when it first appears. It attacks only at the caster's direction. The caster can see through the creature's eyes, though his vision is otherwise unchanged. The caster does not have to maintain concentration to keep the cat in existence or under control. The sand lion fights to the death or until the spell ends, or until the caster dismisses the creature. It can serve as a steed (MV 9). It also can serve as a pack animal, carrying as much asa light horse and retaining a movement rate of 9.
Generally, spells of the enchantment/charm and necromancy schools do not affect the sand lion, nor do priest spells of the Animal, Healing, and Necromantic spheres. However, any spell that specifically affects creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as phase door, can harm the creature even if the spell belongs to a sphere or school previously listed.
The material component of this spell is a handful of sand, tossed into the air. The sand becomes the spotted lion.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; uncommon for alchemists; otherwise very rare.

Spotted Lion: AL N; AC 6; MV 12 (leap 30 feet); HD 6+2; THAC0 15; #AT 3; 1d3/1d3/1d12; SA rear claw rake if both forepaws hit (2d4/2d4).

Conjure Spell Component
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Range: 1 mile/level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: components/level, value under 1 gp each
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard teleports the desired items directly to his hand. The items must be naturally occurring components for spells the wizard knows, and must be within spell range. The components must be items commonly found in the area, such as a twig, feather, firefly, or bit of beeswax in aforest.
If the components lie underground or underwater at a depth greater than 10 feet, they cannot be conjured, even if the caster is at a similar depth (such as in a cavern or at the bottom of a lake).
The spell will not cause the appearance of components whose value exceeds 1 gp. Thus, it is impossible to summon gemstones, crystals, metals, pearls, etc. Additionally, components cannot be man-made or altered from their natural state (such as coins, jewelry, cut or crushed gems, mirrors, etc.), nor can they be taken from someone else's possession.
A single conjure spell component spell will summon three components per level of the caster. They can be three different components or multiples of a single component.
Attempts to conjure an animal's body parts (such as bat fur) produce unpredictable results. The DM should roll on the table.

1d4 Roll	Result
1		Desired component appears.
2		Component does not appear.
3		Creature is teleported to the caster.
4		Caster is teleported to the creature.

Only animals with Intelligence scores of 1-4 can be affected by this spell. Humanoids and fantastic animals (dragons, bugbears, unicorns, etc.) cannot be affected. In all cases, the DM must use common sense to determine the likelihood of the component being located within spell range.
Notes: Uncommon spell (ToM).

Conquer Self
(Abjuration, Alteration)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 6 hrs.
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: Special
Upon the completion of this spell of initiation, the recipient of a block advancement spell begins a great personal ordeal that results either in his death or in the removal of the block and an expetience point bonus, if the wizard is deemed worthy by the power of the conquer self spell. The conquer self spell has no other purpose.
If cast upon an individual not under the effects of a block advancement spell, the casting fails. The conquer self spell must be cast by a wizard of the same alignment as the recipient.
Once cast, the recipient undergoes a six-hour ordeal during which he is rendered helpless by wrenching pains and powerful hallucinatory visions—hence he is usually placed in a special area where he is relatively safe from attack. (Interestingly, The Book of Black Circles reports that the visions experienced during the ordeal are occasionally prophetic or based on actual events or areas that the recipient may not have witnessed.) The outcome of the ordeal is dependent upon the actions of the recipient since he received the block advancement spell.
Although the recipient is automatically affected by this spell if he meets the previous requirements, the final outcome of the spell is dependent upon a successful saving throw of 20. This saving throw roll is modified by several conditions, most of which are dependent on the actions and performance of the recipient. No form of magic affects this saving throw (including items such as a luck stone), and all other saving throw modifiers from which the wizard would normally benefit are similarly ineffective. The modifiers apply only from the time of the application of the block advancement spell. They are as given on the table.

Conquer Self Modifiers
Condition									Modifer
Per 100,000 xp gained:								+1
Perfect alignment performance:							+3
Average alignment performance:							+1
Poor alignment performance:							-1
Every successful (major) quest performed for organization:			+4
Each point of intelligence above 12:						+1
Evaluation of recipient by caster of conquer self: spell (mediated by the DM)	-3 to +3

* Based on subject's ability, ambition, heroic actions, etc.

If the recipient successfully makes his saving throw, he comes out of his trance after six hours, At this time, he regains the spellcasting ability appropriate to his present level and gains a 10% experience point bonus for all experience eamed since block advancement was cast upon him.If the recipient fails the saving throw, he dies at the end of the six hours; he can be raised or resur rected in the usual manner, though he will still suffer from the effects of the block advancement spell. The saving throw is always failed if the result of the roll is a 1, regardless of modifiersto the roll.
The material component of the spell is the jade statue that was used when the block advancement spell was originally applied to the recipient; at the conclusion of the conquer self spell, the statue shatters.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in the Book of Black Circles. (Udated from DraGon MagaZine.)

Construct Undead — Ghul
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: 1 undead
Saving Throw: None
Many ghul lords have found it necessary to create servants from whatever stray bits of human or animal corpses they may find around them. When casting this spell, the ghul lord must first decide just what it is that the servant is supposed todo. Once this is known, the spellcasting can
At the end of the casting, the ghul lord will have created a servant that is ideal for the purpose for which it was created. Such beings have no intelligence and can only perform physical tasks, but they are very good at what they do and will need no instruction to carry out their assignments.
The undead created through this spell are used as laborers or household help and excel at these tasks. They need not be watched as they go about their duties. They are also adept at overseeing zombie or skeleton work details.
Undead created with this spell cannot be used to perform artistic or technical tasks. They aren't good for combat either, fighting as 0 Hit Die monsters with only 1 hit point. However, these undead are turned as if they were of the same Hit Dice as their creator.
The material component for this spell is a complete or near complete corpse (or skeleton) When the spell is completed, the undead will rise up and set about its duties as assigned by the ghul lord.
Notes: Restricted to ghul lords; common.

Construction — Elf
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: Special
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The buildings and structures of Evermeet are constructed using this spell. With it, natural materials such as stone, crystal, and wood can be transformed into sculptures, shelters, buildings, or even great palaces.
The building material must maintain contact with the earth at all times and still be in contact at the end of the spell. The material being effected must be within a radius equal to 10 feet times the level of the caster.
The caster can create any object with a volume equal to 1,000 cubic feet (10 x 10 x 10 feet) per level. Each 1,000 cubic feet so created takes one entire day. Once created, the object can be added to at the same rate (1,000 cubic feet per day) for as long as the caster wishes.
The DM should work with the player to determine the exact nature of the object or structure created. It can be subdivided with rooms, walls, hallways, or chambers as the caster wishes, but the creation of complex areas such as vaulted ceilings, columns, or galleries will add to the overall construction time. Once construction is complete, the structure is permanent and needs no further magical enhancement or maintenance. The building is not subject to dispel magic, though it is subject to dispel enchantment.
Buildings constructed using this technique will maintain the appearance and texture of the substance they were created from.
These structures are also much stronger than those constructed using nonmagical techniques. If besieged or attacked, they receive a +5 bonus to all saving throws (DMG, Chapter 9).
Notes: Restricted to elves; common.

Consume Knowledge
(Alteration, Divination)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
The powerful consume knowledge spell is use ful to wizards needing information quickly. It allows them to absorb instantly the contents of book, scroll, or similar medium for written knowledge. Such information can be absorbedat a rate of one book per round (about 200 pages).
However, the dweomer that allows a wizardto absorb information so quickly physically destroys the book or other record in the process. Nothing short of a wish will restore the consumed writing.
Consume knowledge will not help wizards memorize spells. Further, magical books, tomes, librams, and so on are immune to its power. The spell does not allow the caster to gain any proficiencies more quickly than their normal level advancement allows—the quick consumption of information cannot take the place of practice when gaining skills.
This spell does not grant perfect recall. The facts learned via this spell are as subject to memory loss, fact distortion, and misremembering as information learned normally.
Notes: Rare spell.

Contact Archetype — Dragon
(Divination)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 4 rds.
Duration: 1 question/3 levels
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to the 5th-level wizard spell contact other plane, except that with it a dragon can contact one of the two archetypes of dragonkind—Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, or Tiamat, the Chromatic Dragon. Both powers resent such contact, so only brief answers are given to the questions the caster asks. For every three effective levels (or fraction thereof) it possesses, the dragon can ask one question. Contact with the minds of such powerful creatures poses the risk of insanity; for powerful dragons, this risk is generally lower than for humans contacting extraplanar beings, however. If insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and lasts for 2410 weeks.

Power	Chance of Insanity	Chance to Know	Chance of Veracity
Bahamut	30%			70%		90%
Tiamat	45%			85%		75%

* For each effective level of the caster, decrease the chance of insanity by 1%.

If the archetype doesn't know an answer, and the veracity roll fails, the archetype emphatically gives an incorrect answer. If answer is not known and the veracity roll is successful, the archetype's answer is "unknown."
Tiamat's chance of veracity is decreased by 15% for each step of alignment the questioner is away from Tiamat's lawful evil. (Thus, if the questioner is a chaotic good brass dragon, the chance of veracity is only 15%.)
Notes: Restricted to dragons; uncommon. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Contact Other Plane
(Divination)
(Dimension)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard sends his mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers resent such contact, only brief answers are given, (The DM answers all questions with "yes." "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," etc.) Any questions asked are answered by the power during the spell's duration. The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane farther removed. For every two levels of experience of the wizard, one ques tion can be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the Intelligence of the power contacted determines the effects. The accompanying random table is subject to DM changes, development of extraplanar NPC beings, and so on.
If insanity occurs, it strikesas soon as the first question is asked. This condition lasts for one week for each removal of the plane contacted (see the DMG or the PLanescare Campaign Setting boxed set), to a maximum of 10 weeks. There is a 1% chance per plane that the wizard dies before recovering, unless a remove curse spell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard can recall the answer to the question.
On rare occasions, this divination can be blocked by the action of certain lesser or greater powers.
Percentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental plane.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Plane			Chance of Insanity*	Chance of Knowledge	Chance of Veracity**
Elemental Plane 	20%			55% (90%)		62% (75%)
Inner Plane		25%			60%			65%
Astral Plane		30%			65%			67%
Outer Plane, Int 19	35%			70%			70%
Outer Plane, Int 20	40%			75%			73%
Outer Plane, Int 21	45%			80%			75%
Outer Plane, Int 22	50%			85%			78%
Outer Plane, Int 23	55%			90%			81%
Outer Plane, Int 24	60%			95%			85%
Outer Plane, Int 25	65%			98%			90%

* For every point of Intelligence over 15, the wizard reduces the chance of insanity by 5%.
** If the being does not know an answer, and the chance of veracity is not made, the being will emphatically give an incorrect answer. If the chance of veracity is made, the being will answer "unknown."

Optional Rule
The DM mau allow a specific Outer Plane to be contacted (see the PLANESCAPE Campaign Setting boxed set). In this case, the difference in alignment between the caster and the plane contacted alters the maximum Intelligence that can be contacted by 1. For example, a lawful good caster could contact Mount Celestia (a lawful goof plane) on the "Intellice 20" line,  or Elysium (a neutral good plane) on the "Intelligence 19" line. 

Contagion
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Permanent
Area of E} : 1 creature
Saving Throw Neg.
This spell causes a major disease and weake ness in a creature. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distract ing symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping s, and so on. Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma are reduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased by 2. The effect persists until the character receives a cure disease spell or spends 1d3 weeks taking a complete rest to recover, Those ignoring the contagion for more than a day or so may be susceptible to worse diseases at the discretion of the DM.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Contingency
(Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By meansof this spell, the wizard is able to place another spell upon his person so that the later spell will come into effect under the conditions dictated during the casting of the contingency spell. The contingency spell and the spell it is to bring into effect are cast at the same time (the one-turn casting time indicated is the total for both castings).
The spell to be brought into effect by the prescribed contingency must be one that affects the wizard's person (feather fall, levitation, fly, feign death, etc.) and be of a spell level no higher than 1/4 of the caster's experience level (rounded down), but no higher than the 6th spell level.

Caster Contingency
Level Spell	Level
12-14		4th
15-17		Sth
18+		6th

Only one contingency spell can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is cancelled. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be rather general. For example, a contingency spell cast with an airy water spell might prescribe that any time the wizard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the airy water spell will instantly come into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time the wizard falls more than 2 feet. In all cases, the continency immediately brings into effect the second spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. Note that if complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribe, the whole spell complex (the contingency spell and the companion magic) may fail when
The material components of this spell are (in addition to those of the companion spell) 100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature. In Addition, the spell requires a statuette of ihe wizard carved from elephant ivory (which is not destroyed, though it is subject to wear and tear), which must be carried on the person of the spellcaster for the contingency spell to perform its function when called upon.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Continual Light
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to a light spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the /ight spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. When cast at a creature, the target gets a saving throw vs. spell; success indicates that the spell affects the space about 1 foot behind the creature instead. Note that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs, reducing its attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed ina light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both. The wizard's version of continual light cannot be reversed to create magical darkness.
This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials can last hundreds or even thousands of years.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Control Death Tyrant — Beholder
(Charm, Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 day
Area of Effect: 1 mi./Hit Die
Saving Throw: None
This magic enables an elder orb to control any death tyrant within one mile per current Hit Die of the elder. This control is like a charm person influences humans. The elder orb can simultanebusly control one death tyrant per point of Intellice it currently posses. If faced with more tyrants than its control limit, it can drop control of one in one round and assume control of another in the next. The tyrants involved will do nothing during those two rounds. Death tyrants cannot rebel againist this control, which overrides and always supercedes their directives.
Only an elder orb or an evil wizard of 18 or greater Intelligence can use this spell.
Notes: Restricted to elder orbs (common) and wizards of 18 or greater Intelligence (very rare)

Control Fluid
Components: V, S, M
ea of Effect: 6 cu. ft,/level
ing Throw: Special
This spell allows the caster to control the moves of a quantity of water, oil, acid, or any other fluid. The liquid can be formed into any shape—an upright cylinder, globe, or even a stream or jet—as long as the caster maintains concentration. The controlled liquid can move anywhere within the area of effect at a movement rate of 3, even flowing uphill or through the air if the caster wishes. At 7th level, a typical mass of water is 3 x 2 x 7 feet; a volume a little bigger than man-sized.
The caster can move and engage in combat While maintaining concentration on this spell, but casting another spell breaks his control and ends the spell. If cast on a body of water larger than the "Maximum area of effect, the caster can choose to detach a quantity of fluid and move it away from the original mass, or create extensions or protrusions from the main mass. Another option is to use this spell to divide, push aside, or create air bubbles in the fluid equal in size to the maximum area of effect.
The control fluid spell can be used to drown helpless or stationary creatures by surrounding them in water (see PHB, Chapter 14, Drowning) but the intended victims can easily escape by moving out of the liquid. If employed against creatures with fluid or liquid bodies (water weirds, slimes, oozes, etc.) the target is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to ignore the caster's control.
The material component is a small glass tube and a bit of sponge.
Notes: Uncommon for witches, alchemists and Water mages; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Control Lycanthrope
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special
Any lycanthrope in animal form in the area of effect instantly falls under the caster's control, just as if affected by a charm monster spell. No saving throw is allowed if the creature's Hit Dice are one-third of the caster's level or less. If the wereform Hit Dice are greater than one-third the caster level, or if the human form is 4th level or more, the lycanthrope receives a saving throw. The affected werecreatures willingly obey the caster and follow his orders without hesitation, although suicidal commands or courses of action to which a subject is violently opposed allows the creature a new saving throw vs. spell to escape the caster's control. Creatures that fail this saving throw stand dazed for 1d4 rounds before finally ignoring the command. Any overtly hostile action by the caster breaks the spell.
The control remains even in the werecreature's human form. The affected creature has a cumulative 5% chance per day to shake off the caster's control and regains its free will. Each affected lycanthrope checks individually each day. Depending on how the werecreature was treated, it may leave or track down the caster to exact vengeance once free of the spell.
There is no limit to the number of werecreatures that can be affected with one casting of this spell.
The material component is a shard of polished moonstone, which the caster must keep on his person in order to maintain the spell. Should this stone be removed from the caster, the spell ends automatically.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Control Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 7
Range: 20 yd.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 3d4 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1d6 undead
Saving Throw: Special
This spell enables the wizard to command 1d6 undead creatures for a short period of time. Upon casting the spell, the wizard selects one point within range of the spell. Those undead nearest to this point are affected, until either undead equal in Hit Dice to the caster's level or six undead are affected. Undead with 3 Hit Dice or less are automatically controlled. Those of greater Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. spell, which, if successful, negates the attempt to control that creature. Regardless of the success or failure of the saving throw, each creature required to make a check counts toward the Hit Dice limit of the spell.
Those creatures under the control of the wizard can be commanded by the caster if they are within hearing range. There is no telepathic communication or language requirement between the caster and the controlled undead. Even if communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack the spelicaster. At the endof the spell, the controlled undead revert to their normal behaviors. Those not mindless will remember the control exerted by the wizard.
The material component for this spell is a small piece each of bone and raw meat.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Control Undead — Witch
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: 0.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, a witch can place a single undead creature under her influence, just asif it had been affected by a charm monster spell. No saving throw is allowed if the undead creature has less than half the levels or Hit Dice of the caster, undead creatures with at least half the casters level in Hit Dice or level, but less than the caster, suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throws. More powerful undead are allowed an unmodified saving throw vs. spell, while those with twiceas many Hit Dice or levels as the witch are completely unaffected.
The affected undead creature obeys the casters verbal commands and follows her orders without hesitation, although intelligent undead ignore obviously self-destructive commands, Any overtly hostile action by the caster breaks the spell. There is a cumulative 5% chance per day that an affected undead creature shakes off th witch's control and regains its free will. The mon ster resumes its normal behavior, but intelli undead remember the caster's control and may take steps to ensure that they do not fall under het influence again.
The material component is a shred of cloth from a lich's phylactery, which the caster must keep on her person in order to maintain the spell. If she loses possession of the cloth, the spell ends automatically.
Notes: Restricted to witches; common. Witches use this form of the spell and no other. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Control Vapor
(Alteration)
(ir, Alchemy)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds /level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration; 1 turn
Area of Effect: 30-ft. sphere
Saving Throw: Special
This spell can be cast in two ways: to control the movement of some amount of gas or vapor, or tocreate an area free of gas and vapor.
The first option allows the caster to control the movements of a quantity of gas or vapor, directing the cloud to move anywhere within the area of effect at a movement rate of 6. The wizard can move and engage in combat while controlling the vapors. The vapors can be released to allow the wizard to cast spells. This does not break the spell; the caster can regain control merely by exerting his will.
Alternatively, the caster can create a stationary bubble of vapor-free air up to 30 feet in diameter. Natural and magical vapors, and gaseous creatures as well, are pushed away and cannot enter the protected area. If this casting is used, the caster is free to carry out other actions.
The control vapor spell is effective against any naturally occuring mist or gas, as well as gaseous spells such as wall of fog, stinking cloud, cloudkill, incendiary cloud, and gaseous breath weapons. Gaseous creatures (including creatures in gaseous form) are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to resist the effects and if successful are not controlled by that casting of the spell.
The material component is a small glass tube.
Notes: Uncommon for witches and alchemists; otherwise rare.

Control Weather
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Casting Tim
Duration: 4d6 hrs.
Area of Effect: 4d4 sq. mi.
Saving Throw: None
The control weather spell enables a wizard to change the weather in the local area. The spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours in an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn to cast the spell, and an additional 1d4 turns for the weather conditions to occur, The current weather conditions are decided by the DM, depending on the climate and season. Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart.
The upper-cased headings represent the existing weather conditions. The small headings beneath each large heading are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. Furthermore, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear and warm with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible—fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.
The material components for this spell are burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water. Obviously, this spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions.

Control Winds — Red Wizard
(Alteration)
(Air)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 40-ft,/level radius
Saving Throw: None
By means of a control winds spell, the caster is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every three levels of experience, the caster can increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength (see Wind Force table).

Wind Force 	Miles Per Hour
Light Breeze	2-7
Moderate Breeze	8-18
Strong Breeze	19-31
Gale		32-54
Storm		55-72
Hurricane	73-176

Winds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive small flying creatures (those eagle-sized and under) from the skies, severely affect missile accuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds in excess of 32 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies and cause minor ship damage. Winds in excess of 55 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies, uproot trees of small size, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, endanger ships, and so on. Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force.
An "eye" of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used in underground places, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement, if the spell is cast in an area smaller thanthe area of effect. (For example, if the area ofeffect is a 360-foot radius, and the space only allows a 350-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind.)
Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases ordecreases) by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum (or minimum) speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease, although the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes (or waxes) at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of alike spell up to the limits of his own ability.
Notes: Restricted to the Red Wizards of Thay, Witches, Air mages, and mages of Storm, Weather, and similar specialties. Barred to generalists.

Converse with Sea Creatures
(Alteration)
(Province: Sea)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 10-yd. radius/level
This spell allows the caster to communicate with any sea creature whose intelligence is "animal" or higher. The caster can understand such creatures and respond in the correct tongue. The caster can converse with some or all of the sea creatures within the area of effect, even if they are of different races and do not speak each other's languages.
Like the priest spell speak with animal, this spell does not guarantee that the sea creatures will be friendly toward the caster. The creatures are free to forgo speech and simply attack the caster if they wish.
Nor does this spell enable the caster to breathe underwater. If he can already (through ability, artifact or spell), then the conversation can take place underwater. Otherwise, the caster must remain above, but still can be heard by those who dwell beneath the waves.
The material component of this spell is a small made of a shell, which is consumed by spell's casting.
Common in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Cook
(Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Up to 2 Ibs./level
Saving Throw: None
Doubtless developed by a forgotten wizard with culinary interests, the cook spell instantly transforms the most common and ordinary ingredients into a perfectly prepared feast of the finest and most filling sort. Meats of even dubious freshness and flavor are seasoned to mouth-watering perfection and the exact degree of doneness desired; stale or unappealing vegetables are roasted or broiled to the most demanding tastes. In the process of cooking, all natural harmful agents are removed.
The spell is completely useless against living creatures—or even vegetables still in the ground—so the caster cannot render the head of a live goblin well-done, or broil a shambling mound chasing him.
Up to two pounds of meat and a suitable complement of vegetables, grains, or fruits—a hearty meal for two people—can be prepared per caster level. The caster must specify as he casts the spell how the food is to be cooked and seasoned. The material components are a pinch of tinder and a small dab of sulphur.
Notes: Rare. Known to be in Prismal's Pocket Library, Vol. IV.

Cool — Pluma
(Abjuration)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 4 hrs/level
Area of Effect: 1 individual/level
Saving Throw: None
The spell allows an individual to feel comfortable in conditions that would otherwise debilitate and even injure him, such as desert heat. It is useful to those making arduous treks across such terrain. If actual fire or heat damage would be inflicted—including magical fires, lava, and the like—the individual receives —1 point of damage per die (minimum 1 hit point per die).
The material component for the spell is a bit of duck down.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of pluma magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Cool Strength
(Alteration) (Province: Sea)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 12 hrs./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
The cool strength spell prevents sunstroke, heat exhaustion, sunburn, and other harmful effects associated with hostile environments. The effects last 12 hours for every experience level the caster has. This spell is useful for desert travel as well as long voyages at sea—anywhere blistering heat is abundant and fresh water is scarce.
Even a cold-blooded or water-based creature can benefit from this magic. The spell keeps damp-skinned creatures damp. However, it does not allow water-breathing creatures to function on dry land. This magic cannot stave off the vultures indefinitely. Once its protection ends, the cool strength dweomer will not work again on the same creature for twice the length of time its protection lasted; attempts to cast similar spells fail in the same way.
The material components are a pinch of sand, a drop ofwater, and a drop of blood from the recipient creature. Recipients that lack blood (for example, sandlings) can substitute another lifegiving bodily fluid Creatures that totally lack any such fluid (for example, undead) cannot receive the benefits of this spell.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Copy
(Evocation)
(Geometry)
Level: 1
Range: Special
Components. V, S, M
Casting Time: 1rd.
Duration. Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 page or book
Saving Throw: Special
The copy spell enables the caster to make a perfect copy of a map, letter, or other written or drawn document. The caster must have a blank parchment or a book with blank pages of sufficient size to hold the copy. The caster holds the blank object over the object to be copied, then casts the spell; the copy appears on the formerly blank object. The length of the text is limited to 10 pages of standard size (roughly 9 inches by 12 inches).
The copy is permanent and is a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell cannot duplicate magical writings of any sort.
The material components for this spell are a piece of blank parchment (or a book with blank pages), and a drop of black ink.
Notes: Uncommon spell.

Corpse Host
(Necromancy)
1 Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
1 Casting Time: 1 turn
1 Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables an individual touched by the caster (including himself) to transfer his lifeforce in order to temporarily animate the fresh corpse of a human, demihuman, or humanoid. The spell fails if cast on an undead creature.
The recipient can will the cadaver to move and act and can even cast spells through it—all while his or her own body is safely up to 5 miles away per experience level of the caster. While animated by the intruding lifeforce, the corpse ceases to decay; however, unless illusionary magic is cast upon it, the cadaver will appear to be a form of undead (such as a ju-ju zombie).
The spell recipient can see, hear, and sense through the host body. The host body can fight, talk hoarsely (with the voice of the corpse), and carry things—in fact, it can perform all tasks less exacting than lock picking, sewing, and similar handicrafts. It can even go adventuring and earn experience points for its "master."
The recipient's mind functions in two places simultaneously—within the corpse host and within his real body. The real body can still sense (see, hear, and so on) exactly as before, even benefiting from enhancements such as a magical ring. The tradeoff is paralysis. Aside from breathing, blinking, and moving his eyes, the recipient cannot move his real body while the host is animated. (Friendly guards are a wise precaution; so is a pleasant or strategic view). The recipient's teal body does not need to eat, drink, or sleep While the spell operates.
The recipient is vulnerable when the host body is the target of magical and psionic powers that affect the mind. These are resolved asif the recipient was viewing the illusion or resisting the attack, although physical results affect only the host body.
Physical attacks against the host don't damage the recipient's body, though they do harm to the host body. The host body has a number of "hit points" equal to the recipient's normal maximum hit point total. The host body has the recipient's natural Armor Class (10), though it can wear armor and employ weaponry with the same restrictions that apply to the recipient. The host body does not benefit from anything worn or carried by the recipient's real body, however.
The host body can withstand attacks as well as (or as poorly as) the recipient. Note that since the host body is not undead, it cannot be turned or affected with spells or magical items that influence such creatures.
If the host body drops to 0 or fewer hit points, the recipient must make a system shock roll. Failure indicates that the recipient's body also dies along with the host body. The link between the recipient and host body can be abruptly severed by successfully casting the wizard spells dispel magic, limited wish, or wish, or by employing the priest spells exorcism, spirit release, or dispel evil against the host body. Severance of the mental link in this way also requires the recipient to make a system shock roll in order to survive the ordeal.
The recipient can abandon the link with the host body at any time, with no harm to himself. The host body immediately collapses (resuming its usual decay), and the recipient immediately regains control of his or her real body. The same thing occurs when the spell ends or the host body somehow moves beyond the spell's range or to another plane.
The spell requires a fresh corpse (dead no longer than one day per caster level) and as a material component a freshly-excised patch of the recipient's skin. Taking this piece of flesh from the subject at the time of the casting inflicts 1-3 points of damage. At the conclusion of the spell, the recipient is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic. If failed, the hit point loss is permanent (consumed by the spell) and cannot be reversed or magically healed except with a wish or restoration spell. If successful, the loss in hit points is temporary, but can be regained only by normal rest.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.

Corpse Link
(Alteration, Necromancy)
1 Level: 1
1 Range: 10 yds,/level
1 Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None
With this versatile spell, a wizard establishes a sensory link between himself and a corpse or freshly animated zombie of a human, demihuman, or humanoid within the spell's range. This link allows the caster to gather sensory information from the vicinity of the cadaver or undead being. For every three levels of experience past the Ist, the wizard gains the ability to collect information from an additional sense via the corpse link. At 4th level, for instance, the wizard can choose two senses (three at 7th level, four at 10th level, and all five at 13th level).

* Sight: The caster can see what the corpse or undead creature sees as if looking through one of the creature's eyes.
* Sound: The wizard can now hear through one ear, exactly as if standing at the corpse's current location (ifa wizard/thief, the caster can use his or her hear noise ability, too).
* Smell: With one nostril, the wizard can now smell things exactly as if standing at the corpse's current location. The spell conveniently masks the putrefying stench of the cadaver (if any) so that subtle variations of aroma (like the scent of a rose) can be detected easily.
* Taste: The caster can taste any substance that is introduced into the corpse's mouth. The substance (which may be solid or liquid) tastes exactly as if the wizard had placed it on one side of his or her own tongue. This can be especially useful when checking for poison in food or identifying unknown potions. The taste of the corpse's own rotting flesh is masked out by the spell.
* Touch: The caster gains the ability to sense the textural and environmental conditions, with a single hand, as if standing at the corpse's location. The wizard can gauge the surface texture and temperature of any object or substance that is placed in contact with the corresponding hand of the corpse.

The type and number of sensory signals is chosen by the wizard at the time of the casting, and cannot be changed for the duration of the spell. The caster collects all the sensory information through a single organ (eye, ear, nostril, half of the tongue, or hand) belonging to the corpse or undead creature. This organ need not be attached to the rest of the cadaver for the spell to function properly.
While the spell is in effect, the wizard can still see/hear/smell/taste/touch normally through other (unlinked) organs. For example, a necromancer takes the left eye from a fresh cadaver and places it on a high ledge, with a strategic view of a front door. If the spell is now cast, the wizard's left eye would be able to see through the left eye of the corpse and spy on any visitors, while his or her right eye remains normal.
Furthermore, if the spell was cast on a zombie, the magic enables the caster to issue simple commands to the undead creature via this link. The commands to the undead creature can be no longer than four words and can deal only with the creature's movement (turn left, walk forward two steps, and so on). If either the caster or the undead creature moves beyond the range of the spell, the effects are negated.
The corpse link spell does not impart any animation to dead tissue; if cast on a regular cadaver, it will most likely remain stationary for the duration of the spell.
The spell requires a fresh corpse or newly-animated zombie. Unless some form of preservative magic has been employed to protect the corpse's decaying sensory organs (such as embalm or spirit bind), this spell cannot be employed on the remains of one who has been dead for longer than one day per level of the caster. The material components are the appropriate sensory organs of animals or monsters noted for their keen senses (such as the eye of a hawk, the ear of a rabbit, the snout of a pig, and so on).
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.

Corpse Visage
(Illusion, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell transforms the caster's face or the face of any creature touched by the caster into the horrifying visage of a rotting corpse. The effect of this illusion is so startling that when it is viewed by opponents, the wizard's party adds a modifier of +2 to its surprise roll.
Creatures with Low Intelligence or higher (ability score of5 or more) and with 1 Hit Die or less (or who are Ist level or lower) must make a successful saving throw when first viewing the corpse visage or flee in terror for 1d4 rounds.
Corpse visage does not distinguish between friend and foe, and all who view it are subject to its effects. If the spell is cast upon an unwilling victim, the victim is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect.
The material component is a rag or piece of cloth taken from a corpse. The cloth must be prepared by dotting it with paints of assorted colors.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.

Corpse Whisper
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Special
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special, up to 1 day
Area of Effect: 1 undead
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to transmit a message to an undead creature. The message forms silently in the mind of the corpse in the natural voice of the caster. The caster does not need to be within line of sight of the undead creature, if it is one he currently controls. The caster is not privy to the mind or thoughts of the undead creature.
The undead recipient is forced to obey only if it is not a self-willed undead (that is, a zombie or skeleton) and not under the current control of the caster. Self-willed undead can do as they please, but fear of their master may be enough to spur them into immediate obedience.
The spell establishes a link with the undead creature that allows half as many one-round, onesentence messages to be sent as the caster has levels (round down). For example, after casting the corpse whisper spell on an undead creature, a 9th-level caster could send the creature four messages, each consisting of a single sentence and requiring a single round to send. Even if no commands are sent, the spell wears off after a day.
The creature must be within 40 feet of the necromancer when the spell is cast, but after that the creature can travel up to a mile away and still receive commands. On the Demiplane of Dread, the spell will not function if the caster and undead minion are in different domains and the borders of either domain (or any intervening domain) are closed.
The material component of this spell is the tongue of a dead man. Casting this spell on the Demiplane of Dread requires a RAVENLOFT powers check.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and undead spellcasters; uncommon.

Corpselight
(Alteration, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 body/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes a dead or undead body to glow with a pale radiance. The glow can be white, yellow, green, amber, or red according to the desire of the caster. The caster can alter the glow at will, provided he is within 30 feet of the glowing body. The light can vary from the barest outline to the brightness of a torch, suitable for reading or detailed work.
The glow is diffuse and constant, and does not penalize the undead figure in combat. The caster can affect one man-sized body per level, twice as many small-sized bodies, half as many large bodies, and one-fourth that many huge creatures. Nothing larger than huge can be affected by this spell. The glow does not harm undead creatures in any way. It can be cast on undead that have material form, even if that form is gaseous (such as wraiths, but excluding ghosts, which exist primarily on other planes). This spell can be used by necromancers but not by transmuters.
The material components of the corpselight spell are a pinch of saltpeter and a bit of phosphotous or glowworm.
Notes: Common for necromancers; uncommon for others. Known to be in the tome Against the Undead.

Corruption
(Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
- Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell inundates the target with an emotional flurry of corruption and greed. A person who fails a saving throw vs. spell temporarily succumbs to the temptations of dark power and becomes transfixed, lost among delusions of grandeur, and unable to take any actions for the duration of the spell. Success means the person is completely free of the spell's effect.
After the spell expires, a person who failed the initial saving throw must roll another saving throw vs. spell or be predisposed to favoring the caster. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the target will hesitate for one round before attempting any offensive move against the caster, his minions, or property. As long as the person remains hostile and fails a saving throw at the beginning of the round, the person will delay further any action for one round.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers and undead spellcasters; uncommon, but favored by liches.

Counterspell Immunity
(Abjuration)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: As spell countered
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
An individual enchanted with counterspell immunity becomes immune to the effects of one specific spell. At the time of casting, a wizard speaks the name of the spell to counter; the spellcaster must know it or have it in a spellbook or scroll. Counterspell immunity uses the material components of the spell it counters (if any).
This spell lasts 1d6 rounds, plus one round per level of the caster. However, this duration does not begin until after the spell has been activated—in other words, when the spell to counter has been focused on the target. A countered spell has a percentage chance equal to the counterspell immunity caster's level of reflecting back upon its caster. A spell with an area effect will not be reflected.
For example, consider Hurreck the warrior. His friend Lyrra, an 11th-level mage, has cast counterspell immunity on him to protect him from hold person, When the evil Zrral casts hold person solely upon Hurreck, his spell fails. Zrral faces an 11% chance that his own hold person spell will be reflected back upon him. Had Zrrl spread the hold person spell across several targets, it would not have triggered the immunity.
Notes: Uncommon for abjurers; otherwise very rare.

Create Atmosphere
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: Maximum 1 mo./level
Area of Effect: 1 cu. mi. volume/level
Saving Throw: Special
This difficult spell creates not merely air, but a magically self-renewing atmosphere that survives for one standard (28-day) month per level of the caster. It will last until exhausted or until the reverse of this spell is cast; dispel magic has no effect.
The create atmosphere spell can be cast on an object of any size, and will remain with it regardless of the object's gravity or state (for example, if a ship is destroyed, the spell remains centered on the largest chunk, or a random fragment, as the DM desires). This created atmosphere will replenish the atmosphere of another ship it encounters if their combined atmospheres are within the spell's volume limit, at the rate of 1 ship-ton per turn (that is, the atmosphere of a 24-ton ship can be renewed completely in 1 day). The spell cannot be cast on a creature of any sort.
This spell requires a small, stoppered flask and a drop of water. One hit point is permanently drained from the caster each and every time this spell is cast (a wish or limited wish can restore a hit point lost in this manner).
The reverse, destroy atmosphere, counters create atmosphere. \t has no independent function; that is, it cannot be used to foul or eliminate an atmosphere that was not created by the create atmosphere spell.
Notes: Uncommon for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise very rare.

Create Chosen One — Red Wizard
(Alteration)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 human
Saving Throw: Neg.
Only wizards of evil alignment cast this spell. It consists of a series of magical rituals and torments intended to turn a normal human (upto 3rd. level) into a maddened, murderous creature known as a "chosen one." Victims must be bound and helpless in order for the spell to work. After the long casting time is completed, the victim must save vs. death magic or be transformed into a chosen one under the control of its creator.
In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting the evil Red Wizards of Thay are notorious for their use of this spell.
Notes: Restricted to the Red Wizards of Thay and those trained by them; common.

Chosen One: AL NE; AC 7; MV 12; HD 3; THAC0 17; #AT 3 or 2; Dmg 1d4/1d4/1d8 or weapon/1d8; SA poison; ML Fanatic (18).
The bite is poisonous, save vs. poison or take 1d8 additional poison damage for 1d6 rounds. After 5th combat round, a chosen one has a 1% cumulative chance per round to go berserk (e.g. 5% on the 10th round). A berserk chosen one flees to find and destroy its master.

Create Crypt Thing
(Necromancy)
Reversible
Level: 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to cause a single dead body to animate and assume the status of a crypt thing. This spell can be cast only in the tomb or grave area the crypt thing is to protect; the spell requires that the caster touch the skull of remains until destroyed. Only one crypt thing can guard a given tomb.
A successful dispel magic spell returns the crypt thing to its original, unanimated state. Attempts to restore the crypt thing before this is done fail for any magic short of a wish,
The reverse of this spell, destroy crypt thing, utterly annihilates any one such being when it is touched by the caster (attack roll required). The crypt thing is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to avoid destruction.
Notes: Very rare spell.

Create Darkenbeast
(Alteration)
(Shadow)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 animal/level, 20-ft. diameter
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables a wizard to transform one or more mammals into darkenbeasts. Only animals of 2 Hit Dice or less are affected by this spell. The animals to be transformed must all be within a 20-foot-diameter circle. The spell automatically affects ordinary, nonmagical mammals of semiintelligence or less. Animals with an Intelligence of 5 or more get a saving throw vs. spell to resist. Humans, humanoids, and demihumans are immune. The wizard can transform one animal for each level of his experience.
The spell can be cast only in darkness (for example, night, inside, or underground) and its effects last until daylight strikes the darkenbeast. At that time, the creature automatically reverts to its true form, Slain darkenbeasts also revert when struck by daylight. The spell sun ray or a magical sun sword breaks the spell, but a continual light spell has no effect.
The material component is dried wyvern's blood.
Notes: Rare spell. This spell is used mostly by

DarkenbeastL INT Semi-; AL NE; AC 4; MV 18; HD 5+5, hp 29 each; THAC0 15; #AT 1 (fangs) or 3 (claws and fangs); Dmg 3-12 or 1-4/1-4/3-12; SD immune to mind control; MR 25%; SZ L (20-ft. wingspan); ML Special; XP 975.
A darkenbeast suffers -1 to attack rolls when exposed to bright light. A darkenbeast is telepathically controlled by the creator (do not check for morale) and cannot be summoned by another wizard.

Create Darkness — Drow
(Alteration)
(Shadow)
Level: 3
Range: 40 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 50-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special
This spell instantly extinguishes all nonmagical sources of illumination in the area of effect. Magical light sources, including light shed by magical weapons, may be extinguished as well: Each such device or item is allowed a saving throw vs. disintegration to resist the effect. Items that fail are not destroyed, merely extinguished.
Normal light sources extinguished by this spell cannot be relit for one hour. Magical light sources receive a saving throw at the beginning of each turn with a +4 bonus to the roll; they relight themselves when the saving throw is made or, at worst, one full hour after being extinguished.
Notes: Uncommon for drow and spellcasters of the Underdark; otherwise rare.

Create Death Tyrant — Beholder
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 20 ft.
Components: V
Casting Time: 3 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 beholder/Hit Die or level
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a caster, usually an elder orb, to create death tyrants from the shells or corpses of dead beholders. One death tyrant is created for each Hit Die of the elder orb or level of the caster. The spell does not allow permanent control of the undead beholders. The caster controls the death tyrants created by this spell for 1d12 rounds, plus 1 round per caster level. Thereafter, the caster must use a control death tyrant spell to maintain control. Casting this spell is an inherently evil act. Only elder orbs or evil wizards of 18 or greater Intelligence can use this spell.
Notes: Restricted to elder orbs (common) and evil spellcasters with an 18 Intelligence or more (very rare).

Create Enchanted Tattoo — Red Wizard
(Alteration) .
Level: 2 ff
Range: Touch is
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the creation of enchanted tattoos. The exact nature of the tattoo is determined by the caster, and the tattoo's effect is based upon the level of the caster. Only one tattoo is created by this spell, although multiple applications are possible.

* A wizard of 3rd to 6th level can inscribe the following tattoos:
+1 to any one saving throw (vs. death magic, vs. wands, and so on);
+1 to attack rolls; or
-l to AC.

* A wizard of 7th to 12th level can inscribe the lower level tattoos, plus the following:
+1 to all saving throws;
One extra attack every two rounds; and One extra spell—this can be of Ist or 2nd or 3rd level (only one spell, and only one level, not one of each),

* A wizard of 13th level or higher can inscribe all of the above tattoos plus the following:
+5% magic resistance;
+1 to any one attribute; or
+1 level of casting ability (this increases the caster's effective level, but not the total number of spells—an 1 Ith-level wizard raised in casting ability in this manner casts spells as a 12thlevel wizard in terms of range, area of effect, and so on, but does not gain access to the increased number of spells or to 6th-level spells until he actually becomes a 12th-level wizard).
Several restrictions limit the number and type of magical tattoos that an individual can bear. An individual cannot have more than three enchanted tattoos, and none of these can be of the same type. The casting wizard must also have a modicum of artistic talent, to sketch the desired tattoo. Some skin artists in Bezantur and elsewhere have prospered solely from their natural artistic talent and the use of this spell.
Red Wizards of Thay often bear enchanted tattoos on their faces and shaved heads. It is believed that casters in arabian, oriental, and savage set tings have their own versions of the create enchanted tattoo spells.
Notes: Common for the Red Wizards of Thay; otherwise very rare.

Create Major Helm
(Enchantment/Charm) i 4
(Artifice)
Level: 7
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn/level
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard can transforma normal chair or seat into a major spelljamming helm suitable for powering a ship through space. This spell does not replace the need for a permanent magical helm onboard, and is used primarily in emergency situations. Its casting ages the caster one year.
The major helm can power a ship of no more than three times the spellcaster's level in tonnage.
A 20th-level wizard can therefore create a major helm capable of powering a 60-ton ship. In operation, a major spelljamming helm created in such a fashion is identical to a regular, permanent helm, with one exception. If dispelled, the helm created by this spell will disappear for a single round, then reappear.
Creating a helm counts as the casting of one spell, and therefore reduces the caster's effectiveness in using the helm for that day. Of course, this does not mean another spellcaster cannot act as the helmsman, using a helm created by another person.
The spell requires a chair, stool, or other seat suitable for use as a helm.
Notes: Uncommon for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise very rare.

Create Minion
(Necromancy) Level: 9 ane
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1-20 days
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is used in conjunction with confer in order to create a quasimancer. When the minion iscreated, a corporeal undead minion is animated and reinstated with a portion of its former life essence, giving it artificial intelligence and spellcasting potential. In terms of physical traits, the minion becomes a wight, having all the abilities and statistics of that creature (see the Monstrous Manual Tome).
The minion is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell (as a 5 Hit Dice creature) to avoid falling under control of the caster. If it succeeds, it will do its best to escape and then go ona killing spree, resentful of the knowledge that its time of existence is limited. (Some created minions may try to find a wizard and force him to cast permanency upon them, thus negating the 1-20 day expiration of the spell.) If it fails, it falls under complete control of the caster and can act as its master's agent in the field. Its intelligence allows it to command other undead in its master's name, and it remains susceptible to the confer spell.
Created minions under control make all saving throws at the level of their master; they are immune tocharm, sleep, enfeeblement, polymorph, electricity, insanity, cold, and death spells; they exude a fear aura, 5-foot radius, requiring a successful save vs. spell or flee for 2d4 rounds.
A living person subjected to this spell must make a successful save vs. death magic or die, becoming a created minion and entitled to the saving throw as detailed above.
The material components of this spell are the body to be raised and abit of brain matter
Notes: Uncommon for necromancers; otherwise very rare. This spell can be learned only on its plane of origin.

Create Minor Helm
(Enchantment/Charm) z $
(Artifice)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M.
Casting Time: 1 turn/level
Duration: 1 week/level
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard can transform a normal chair or seat into a minor spelljammer helm suitable for powering a ship through space. This spell does not replace the need for a permanent magical helm onboard, and is used primarily in emergency situations. Casting this spell ages the caster one year.
The minor helm can power a ship of no more than twice the caster's level in tonnage; a 20thlevel wizard can therefore create a helm capable of powering a 40-ton ship. In operation, a minor helm created in such a fashion is identical to a regular, permanent spelljammer helm, with one exception, Ifa helm created by this spell is successfully dispelled, it will disappear and must be created anew.
Creating a helm counts as the casting of one spell, and therefore reduces the caster's effectiveness in using the helm for that day. Of course, this does not mean another spellcaster cannot act as the helmsman, using a helm created by another person.
The spell requires a chair, stool, or other seat suitable for use as a helm.
Notes: Uncommon for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise very rare.

Create Mythal
This spell was used in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting to create the great mythal cities such as Myth Drannor. This spell required 9 wizards of reputed 41st level or greater! It is rumored to have permanently drained 1d6 hit points from each caster. The gods later took such power away from mortals.

Create Portal
(Alteration)
Level: 5
Range: 100 yds.
Create Portal
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 2d6 turns
Area of Effect: Crystal shell area, 100 ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell can be cast only within 100 yards of a crystal shell surface. The spell causes a large area of the shell to become temporarily insubstantial and ethereal, allowing a ship (or anything else) of suitable size to pass through. The effect lasts for up to 12 turns, during which time any other ships or items can pass through.
The opening does not weaken the crystal shell, and any objects resting physically on the shell are unaffected by the portal. It takes but a fraction of a round for a ship to pass through a portal opened in this fashion. However, if the portal is dispelled or otherwise prematurely closed, roll 1d10 to determine the fate of the object passing through the opening as it closes (see table).

Roll	Result
1-5	Portal closes before ship reaches shell. Ship must turn or ram the shell.
6	Portal closes on the ship. Ship is cut in half.
7-10	Portal closes after ship passes through.

Portals created by this spell are magical and temporary, and can be dispelled. Portals that occur naturally in a crystal shell cannot be dispelled.
The material component of the create portal spell is a piece of wire wrapped about a bit of amber.
Notes: Common for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise very rare.

Create Shade
(Alteration)
(Province: Sand) eae
Level: 7
Range: 10 yds /level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 turn/level + 2d4 turns
Area of Effect: 10-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: None
This magic creates a cool, shaded patch of ground for the comfort, rest, and survival of crea tures stranded in a hot desert or other sun-baked place. The area is clearly delineated by a patch of dark shade on the ground, though there is no object to cast such a shadow. Those within the area of effect require less water, just like individuals in natural shade.
The spell does not otherwise modify temperature. Provided all can fit in the shaded area, any number of creatures can enjoy these benefits. In fact, this spell often attracts a large numberof unwanted life-forms (such as insects). Other spells can be cast within the shaded area—for example, to eliminate unwanted intruders—without destroying the shade. Of course, a successful dispel magic causes the magical shade to disappear immediately. The caster doesn't have to concentrateto maintain the spell. He's free to sleep, study spells, or undertake intricate activities within the shade, without risking its loss. He can end the create shade spell instantly by an act ofwill. !
There is no material component for the create _ shade spell, but it must be cast on sand or solid, natural ground. Cast on aroof or on the deck of a ship, ! it fails. Once cast, the shade cannot be moved. It remains in place regardless of the sun's position.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise virtually unknown.

Create Shade
(Alteration)
(Shadow) 1
Level: 9
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 day
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 being
Saving Throw: None
This powerful spell infuses one being with shadowstuff from the Demiplane of Shadow and transforms that individual into a shade. The subject must be a single-classed human or demihuman (warrior, priest, thief, wizard, or psionicist only) of at least 10th level. Only a free-willed wizard can cast this spell successfully.
The casting of this spell is a long, delicate, and highly complex procedure. The caster and the subject must not be disturbed at all, or else the spell will fail. The caster must additionally cast shadow walk, Lorloveim's shadowy transformation, gate, and permanency upon the subject for the transformation to succeed. Upon completion off all the castings, the subject must survive a system shock roll.
A 25% bonus can be added to this roll if this spell is cast on the Demiplane of Shadow itself. A percentile roll less than or equal to the survival chance indicates that the subject has been transformed successfully into a shade. Failure means that the subject dissolves away into Shadow—lost forever—not even a wish can recover the subject.
It is possible for the subject to undergo an alignment change by this spell (see table). A wish spell can be used to prevent any change in alignment, After the spell is cast, the wizard loses 1d6 Constitution points and loses consciousness for 1d8 days. He also ages five years if he cast a wish spell to prevent an alignment change.
The material components for this spell are 10,000 gp worth of powdered onyx, 10,000 gp worth of powdered diamond; further, an amulet of the planes is also required to focus the magical energy. The powdered onyx and diamond are consumed during the casting of the spell, while the amulet is used to draw forth the necessary amounts of shadowstuff and planar energy from the Demiplane of Shadow and the Positive and Negative Material Planes respectively.
Notes: Very rare. This spell can be researched only on the Demiplane of Shadow.

Create Slipgate
(Chronomancy)
Level: 5
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 20 sq. ft.
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting this spell, the chronomancer twists the momentum of time to create a permanent gate between reality and the Demiplane of Time. The slipgate is totally flat, but it can be in any contiguous shape the caster desires, up to 20 square feet in area. The caster must make a save vs. spell once the spell has been cast; failure indicates that the slipgate collapses.
If successful, care must be exercised, since denizens of the timestreams are attracted to such portals and may be lying in wait on the Demiplane of Time or might possibly come through into reality, Slipgates are a liability as much as a convenience. A successful dispel magic can collapse the portal.
The material component for this spell is a diamond worth 5,000 gp that has been on Demiplane of Time for over one subjective day. The diamond is destroyed in the process.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Create Soundstaff
(Enchantment, Evocation)
(Province: Wind; Artifice)
Level: 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 60 days (charging) + 10 days (use)
Area of Effect: 1 wooden staff
Saving Throw: None
This spell helps dampen "excess" noise by gathering it in a wooden staff. The staff is planted in the ground or atop a roof when the spell is cast. For 60 days, it creates a spherical area of relative peace and quiet, up to 100 yards in any direction from the staff. Though normal conversations and spellcasting can occur in this area, the staff creates at least the illusion of a placid, peaceful area, even in the hubbub of a city marketplace or in a private garden beyond which a riot is occurring.
The staff "muffles" sonic attacks; all saving throws against such attacks in the area of effect gain a +1 bonus. More importantly, the staff fully absorbs all errant sounds "dumped" in the area as a result of sand whisper or similar magics. Sound-based attacks that are "dumped" by such magics are absorbed, too, and inflict no damage to those within the staff's area of effect. Examples include harpy songs, shout spells, and power word spells.
After 60 days, the staff can contain no more. It must be removed from its position before the start of the 61st day, or all magic within it is simply lost. (The same occurs, however, if the staff is moved prematurely.) Assuming the staff is removed promptly, it can function as a weapon for 10 days, emitting a sonic blast in the shape of a cone 60 feet long, with the tip at the staff, spreading to a base of 20 feet.
Those caught within the blast suffer the effects of power word stun. The staff can contain 2d6 of these charges. At the start of the llth day, any remaining magic dissipates harmlessly, leaving the staff ready to receive more sound—as soon as the create soundstaff spell is cast upon it again.
Ruling emirs or local councils often ask wizards to maintain soundstaves throughout their cities (assuming the area has wizards of sufficient power). The wizards usually do this in return for a small token of gratitude, such as favors from their rulers or permission to conduct magical experiments undisturbed within the city confines.
To create a soundstaff, the caster must first fashiona staff of dark wood, with a white or blue stone worth at least 300 gp at its tip.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Create Spectral Wizard
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows the caster to cause a human or elf wizard or a gnome illusionist to die and become a spectral wizard. If the spell is caston an unwilling recipient, the victim is alloweda 1 saving throw vs. death magic to negate the spell.
In the process of dying and becoming undead, the spell recipient is drained of 1d4 levels. Once animated, the spectral wizard is free-willed, but any utterance from its creator acts as a suggestion — spell upon it. Only a wish spell can free a spectral wizard of its undead state, A spectral wizard restored to life has a 50% chance to be restored with his original levels intact. It is possible that1 another undiscovered process can restore the spectral wizard entirely.
Notes: Rare for necromancers; very rare for others. Known to be in Kyristan s Mysteries.

Spectral Wizard: AC 0(8 on the Ethereal Plane); MV 12, Fl 15.8) HD 5; THAC0 15; #AT 1; Dmg 0 or weapon; SA paralyze (one limb, 2d4 rounds), spellcasting ability as a wizard of a given level; SD Attackers at -1; silver or magical weapon to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, fear, polymorph, paralyzation, and death magic; turned as a spectre.
Normally noncorporeal, spectral wizards are AC8 if fought on the Ethereal Plane. They can solidify with great effort to use material components or weapons; this takes 1 round in darkness to 2d4 rounds in bright light.

Create Talisman of Hishna
(Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3-18 months
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
This is the procedure by which a master artisan creates an item of hishna, talon magic. The object is more than a magical item; it is a work of art, and a piece of great personal pride to the artisan.
As with talismans of p/uma, the listed items are a representative list. They are not of the "blow up the village" power level. If this restraint is kept in mind, player and DM designed talismans of hishna can be invented and added to the campaign easily (see Typical Talismans of Hishna).
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of hishna magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Typical Talismans of Hishna
Fire Peppers: This enchantment creates 4d20 tiny round objects. Each is bright red and the size of a small pebble. They can be used to immobilize the unsuspecting (or do worse).
When dissolved in up to a gallon of drinkable liquid, a fire pepper creates an odorless threat. Anyone who takes an exploratory sip is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful the person is incapacitated for 1d6 rounds, gasping and choking and writhing on the ground in pain from the hot burn of the drink, and takes 1 point of damage per round. Anyone failing a saving throw, or who takes an unwary drink of the liquid is incapacitated for 2d6 rounds and takes 1 point of damage per round.
Someone tricked into eating a pepper whole must make an immediate system shock roll or die. For each pepper beyond the first taken in a single bite, the individual suffers a —5% to the system shock survival chance. Those who survive are incapacitated for 3d6 rounds and take 1point of damage in each round.

Heartseeker: This is a heavy spear, almost like a footman's lance. Its head of hardened obsidian has been layered with the power of hishna. The weapon has a bonus of +2 to all attack and damage rolls. It is immune to the breakage rules for normal obsidian. When it hits on a natural roll of 20, the weapon strikes the heart, and the foeloses all remaining hit points.

Sandals of Speed: These stout leather sandals increase the wearer's base speed to 18. However, unlike boots of speed, they confer no Armor Class benefit, nor do they require any special period of rest. The wearer can cover vast distances, jogging along for 16 hours a day:

Spiderwalker: The spiderwalker is an enchanted being created from the body of a dried tarantula. When imbued with the power of hishna, it becomes a deadly terror.
It can be activated only at night, and will last only for the duration of that night. It ceases to funcwith the first rays of the sun—even if the sunrise is concealed by clouds or if the spiderwalker is indoors or underground.

The creature can spring up to 10 feet to attack. It can drop from any height, falling with great accucy (+2 to hit) onto a victim below. A spiderwalker can be given very specific instructions by one who knows the command word. It can be directed to strike at a single individual, or to attack s many of a certain type (for example, enemy warriors) as it can encounter,
Spiderwalker: AC -4; MV 6; HD 13; THAC0 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1 + poison (save or die).

Talon of Zaltec: This isa small object made from the claw of a jaguar. The tip contains a lethal venom (-4 to saving throws). The wielder of the talon must make a successful attack roll in hand-tocombat; the individual struck must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or die. A single talon contains enough venom for 1d10 doses.

The other use of the talon is contained in the wide upper end of the claw. This contains a small ammount of powder. If cast into the eyes of someone within 5 feet, that individual must save vs. spell or be blinded for 24612 hours. All victims are considered AC10 for purposes of the blinding powder. The talon contains enough powder for 2d12 uses.

Create Talisman of Pluma
(Alteration, Enchantment)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 year + 3d6 months
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
This is the procedure by which a master artisan creates an item of pluma, feather magic. The talisman created is more than a magical item; it is a work of art, and apiece of great personal pride to the artisan.
The works listed here are not the only items that can be made; they are a representative list. Players and DMs will note that they are not of the "blow up the village" power level. If this restraint is kept in mind, player and DM designed items of pluma can easily be invented and added to the campaign (see Typical Talismans of Pluma).
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of plum magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Typical Talisman of  Pluma
Bands of Might: These thin bands of pluma are worn around the wrists. They can greatly enhance the wear's Strength-- to 18/00, 19, or even 20. The exact increase is determinedby the Dexterity and Wisdom ability scores of the pluma artisan; take the lowest score and add +3. This Strength conveyed by the wrist bands to the hands and arms of the individual.
The wrist bands benefit crushing and pummeling, as well as weapon-wielding power. They do not allow the casting of boulders. See table.

Effects of Bands of Might
Strength	Bonuses		Open
Rating		to Hit	Damage	Doors
18/00		+3	+6	none
19		+3	+7	16(8)
20		+3	+8	17(10)
21		+4	+9	17(12)
22		+4	+10	18(14)

Feathertoken: This is a powerful charm of magic resistance and protection. It conveys an Armor Class bonus of +3 and an inherent magic resistance of 90%. The area of protection extends for 10 feet from the wearer. In addition, the feathertoken can effect a featherfall spell once per day. The spekk can benefit the wearer of the token and anyone touching that person.
Moccasins of Free Movement: These beaded leather shoes are wondrous talismans that convey numerous effects: They function as boots of elvenkind in regards to allowing silent movement, they allow the wearer to move at his full rate, whatever the footing--as long as he is walking. Thus the wearer can cross swams, wade shallow water (but not swim), even cross a sticky pool of tar, as if he walked  upon smooth, level ground.

Plumalitter: The plumalitter is a work of featherweaving that is the only maztican equivalent of a wagon. It is a rectangle of thick, fluffy plumage some 6 feet wide, 10 feet long, and 1 foot thick. It can carry up to 750 pounds. It requires a command word, but not an elevate spell, to activate. It will follow the one who commands it, matching his speed at a movement rate of up to 18. It can rise or descend at the rate of 30 feet per round.

Plumastone: The artisan who makes this talisman must be a weaponmaker as well as a master of pluma. An item of plumastone is an enchanted weapon with an obsidian tip or edge

It can be a maca (a club edged with obsidian chips), a knife, a bundle of three spears, or a quiver of ten arrows.
The objects are not subject to the normal breakage rules for obsidian-tipped weapons. In addition, each receives a bonus of +2 to hit and +3 to damage rolls.

Skin of Pouring: This is a featherd waterskin that is always full. It can be used to pour forth water at the rate of 1 gallon per round.

Create Tree of Life
(Alteration, Enchantment)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 tree
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell a wizard can enchant a living sapling to become a tree of life, a magical item of tremendous power. Any tree less than one year old will suffice; this spell cannot be cast on an older tree. The sapling must have already sprouted from the ground, though the wizard can transplant such a sapling before casting the spell. The sapling grows to its full size in only one week, but has its full powers and capabilities immediately after the spell is cast.
The material component is a piece of copper wire formed in the shape of a tree.
Notes: Usable only on Athas (the Dark SUN setting), where it is common. The basic Dark SUN setting has full details about the sreeof life in the magical item section.

Create Watchghost
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 50 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to animate a corpse with the spirit and intelligenceof its former self and bind it into service until the demise of the caster. The create watchghost spell must be cast within five years of the corpse's death. Once animated, the watchghost remains until its destruction.
During the casting, the necromancer issues the watchghost's commands. Watchghost commands cannot require more than one task. Those commands must specifically define the terms of what task the watchghost is to do, how it carries out that lask and one exemption, if any, to its commanded tusk. For example. "You are to guard my laboratory against all intruders except for myself. Kill anything that tries to enter my laboratory." During its time of service to its creator, the watchghost's alignment is lawful, though evil or good alignments are unchanged from its former life. Upon the death of the caster the watchghost is freed from its orders and is free to roam, its orginal personality and mind inhabiting a powerful undead shell.
The material components are 1,500 gp worth of diamond dust, four of the caster's teeth ground to powder, and a handful of the caster's hair. The material components tie the lifeforce of the caster into the commands and the service of the watchghost.
Notes: Very rare; known mostly to a few

necromancers.

Create Water
(Conjuration)
(Water)
Reversible
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 gallon/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a wizard to create pure, cool water. The water is crystal clear and sparkling, with exceptional taste. This enchantment is favored by adventuring wizards who memorize the spell to ensure that they will have drinking water during their journeys.
The reverse of this spell, destroy water, allows a wizard to instantly evaporate one gallon of water per level of experience.
Notes: Uncommon for Water wizards; otherwise very rare.

Create Water
(Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 20 cu. ft-/level
Saving Throw: None
This magic creates pure, cool, safe water: fresh or salt, as the caster desires. The water pours from the caster's hand, and will run away and be lost without available container(s) to hold it (although others can drink from the hand asif from a spout, or bathe in the flow). At the base level, this creates about 2,500 gallons, which will require about two hours to discharge.
Once begun, the spell continues until the caster's maximum volume has been created; the caster cannot turn off the flow and then turn it back on again, or save any for later emission. (The caster can move about to fill various containers and water various plants, or to avoid flooding a specific area, without affecting the flow). The flow of water is not powerful enough to disturb the caster's movement or to cause damage as a weapon. Although the water thus created is permanent, it evaporates as all water does in desert conditions, and may sink into the sand and be lost.
The material component is a drop of the caster's spittle or tears.
Notes: Common for Bedine desert sorcerers; otherwise very rare.

Creeping Darkness
(Evocation)
(Shadow)
Level: 5
Range: 240 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 3 rds./level
Area of Effect: 30 cu. ft.
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a small, amorphous cloud of inky blackness (about 2 x 3 x 5 feet). The cloud can be shaped and moved as desired by the caster throughout the duration of the spell if he maintains concentration upon it and does not move it beyond spell range. It has a movement rate of 6.
The blackness can seep through the smallest cracks and float in the air, as desired. The cloud is impenetrable to all types of vision except a true seeing or similar spell. It also blots out all sound within the cloud (20% chance of miscasting spells with verbal components by spellcasters encased by it),
The blackness is susceptible to wind, The area of effect is reduced by 1 cubic foot and the duration by one round for every 5 m.p.h. of wind. While concentrating on the spell, the wu jen can normally move no more than 3 per round.
The material components for this spell area whisker from an old black cat and atiny bottle of smoke captured on a moonless night.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; very rare elsewhere.

Crimson Scourge
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 human
Saving Throw: Neg.
This terrible bleeding curse can affect one human of the spellcaster's level or less. Dwarves, elves, and other demihuman and humanoid creatures are immune to this magic. Upon pronouncing the curse, the wizard touches the victim, who receives a saving throw vs. spell at -2.
Failure means the victim begins to bleed profusely through the pores of the skin, taking 1-2 points of damage per round until dead. Regular first aid cannot prevent this damage, and most magical cures such as cure light wounds and cure disease have no effect upon the affliction. Such spells as cure serious wounds and cure critical wounds can staunch the hemorrhaging, but hit points can be regained fully only through time and rest. A remove curse followed immediately by a heal spell can negate the effect of this evil magic entirely.
The most horrible property of the crimson scourge, however, lies in the "contagiousness" of its effects, for whenever an afflicted victim comes into physical contact with someone else, the touched person may have to make a saving throw vs. spells at -2 or become likewise afflicted, An individual is immune to the curse so long as he has more levels or Hit Dice than the bleeding person; moreover, the spellcaster can never suffer the effects of his own crimson scourge. This plague often goes by the name of "the red death."
The working of this curse requires that the wizard wear a scarlet robe and a faceless red mask, both made from the finest silk, worth at least 1,000 gp each. These garments can be reused as many times as desired.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in The Cryptichronos, aka The Book of Horrors. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Crushing Sphere — Phaerimm
(Evocation)
Level: 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Duration: 4 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature (size L or smaller)
Saving Throw: Special
This spell creates a shimmering sphere of force around a single target creature, which over four rounds tightens and crushes the trapped individual. Besides casting the spell against a chosen creature, the phaerimm can direct it at a suspected creature's location—perhaps picked out by the phaerimm's detect magic ability. If the phaerimm can't actually see a target and several target creatures are present, the spell affects one chosen randomly.
The target creature receives a saving throw vs. spell at a -3 penalty. If successful, the sphere collapses in a spectacular burst of white light motes. If failed, the sphere forms around the creature and begins pressing inward. In this round only, the creature can trigger an item or cast a spell freely. The target creature is slowed. However, as the magical sphere partially protects the victim against outside magical and physical attacks, the net effects are as follows:
* Magical item effects and spells pass through the sphere without harming it.
* The creature loses any Dexterity-related combat bonuses.
* The creature benefits from a 2-point improvement to its Armor Class.
* Magical or physical attacks passing through the sphere to reach the trapped creature inflict less damage, —2 points per die, to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die.
* The creature has a -4 attack roll penalty.
* The creature is constricted each round. A constricted victim takes 1d4 points of damage the first round, 2d4 the second, 3d4 the third round, and 4d4 the fourth. An armor, barkskin, shield or similar protective spell reduces the damage by 1d4 points per round (no damage the first round of constriction). Such protections can't form once constriction begins; if cast by a trapped creature, they are wasted. Long, rigid carried items (a quarterstaff, or an extended rod of lordly might) will prevent damage for one round, deforming the sphere and limiting it to 1d4 points of damage per round.
Constricted victims can't use spells with somatic components the round trapped, and later buffeting by pseudopods of force will prevent spellcasting at all A creature with flight ability is increasingly hindered as the sphere closes; wings (even magical) will lose the ability to function properly. The tightening sphere gradually prohibits the victim from writing anything, picking a lock, or performing any other task requiring a high level of dexterity The use of items is likewise hindered: The sphere will prevent a rod of lordly might from extending into a ladder or climbing pole, for instance.
A dispel magic spell destroys a crushing sphere instantly and harmlessly. Destructive spells (such as fireball) do not harm the sphere, but do harm a trapped victim who is not immune to their effects. If a crushing sphere ever comes into contact with certain other spells, special results occur:
* Wall of Force: The sphere instantly absorbs the wall. The sphere gains duration equal to the remaining duration of the wall. Sphere damage continues to increase each round (5d4 damage on the 5th round, 6d4 on the 6th, and so on).
* Globe of Invulnerability: A spectacular explosion ends both spells instantly. All within, protected by, or trapped in either spell effect take 6d6 points of damage and must successfully save vs. spell or be feebleminded Other beings within 30 feet must save vs. spell or suffer 2d6 points of blast damage. Missiles passing within 80 feet of the contact point are destroyed or deflected, missing their targets.
* Prismatic spell (of any sort): A spectacular explosion ends the sphere and the prismatic spell loses 1d4 colors, in order. The other effects are the same as for the globe of invulnerability.
A crushing sphere cannot be cast into or while inside an existing globe of invulnerability or prismatic magic, or vice versa: such magics are simply wasted when cast.
If a sphere is cast around an ethereal creature or one that exists in more than one plane at a time, the creature is forced entirely into the other plane (the one the crushing sphere was not cast in). The creature can return to the plane from which it was forced if it has the power or means to do so.
The somatic component of this spell is a closing, crushing motion of oneof the caster's hands.

Crystalbrittle
(Alteration)
(Alchemy)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components. V,S
Casting Time: 9
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 2 cu. ft/level
Saving Throw: Special
The magic of this spell causes metal, whether as soft as gold or as hard as adamantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as brittle and fragile as crystal. Thus, a sword, metal shield, metal armor, or even an iron golem can be changed to a delicate, glasslike material easily shattered by any forceful blow. Furthermore, this change is unalterable by any means short of a wish spell; a dispel magic will not reverse the spell.
The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn bya creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected, and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% chance to save (average of the two pluses); +5 magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts and relics constructed of metal can be affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely. Affected items not immediately protected are shattered and permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or any weighty weapon, including a staff.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Cubehopper
(Alteration)
(Dimension)
Level: 6
Range: Infinite (plane of Acheron)
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: 2 cubes of Acheron
Saving Throw: None
The cubehopper spell opens a temporary portal between any two "cubes" in the lower plane called Acheron, providing quick, safe transport for small raiding parties operating on that plane. The portal lasts until a number of creatures equal to the caster's level have passed through or until the duration ends. The caster can dispel the cubehopper portal at will.
Rumors state the cubehopper spell can be used to teleport between the planar layers of Acheron as well, but this is said to require a special spell key, which the rumormongers never seem to know.
Leaders of orc and goblin armies are notorious for using the cubehopper spell to escape routs and massacres (providing, of course, that their opponents haven't been quick enough to cast gate seal over the battle).
The material component of this spell is a chip of iron from each of the cubes to be connected.
Notes: Very rare; virtually unknown except to planar travelers; virtually useless except on the plane of Acheron.

Curse of Forgetfulness
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Mentalism)
Reversible
Level. 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 spellcaster
Saving Throw: None 1
By means of this spell, a wizard bestows a special curse on a spellcaster that destroys the subject's ability to comprehend certain spells. Lost spells cannot be rememorized or even cast from a scroll; the mind of the victim simply cannot understand and enact them.
Spells known to the victim are lost at random, beginning with spells currently memorized. One spell is lost instantly. An additional spell is lost every 10 days thereafter until the victim forever loses all spellcasting ability. Priest spells are not subject to this spell.
A remove curse spell does not affect this special curse; a limited wish or wish spell is necessary. Imbibing an undiluted sweet water potion, (not its usual application, hence this remedy is known to a few) will halt but not reverse the effects of a curse of forgetfulness.
The reverse of this spell, bestow remembrance, reverses the effects of a curse of forgetfulness, a forget spell, and similar magics.
Notes: Uncommon for witches; otherwise very rare.

Curse of Lycanthropy
(Abjuration, Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time:
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell inflicts a special form of lycanthropy on the person touched. Only humans, demihumans, and some humanoids can be affected, and true lycanthropes or shapeshifters are naturally immune. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to resist the spell's effects; failure subjects the person to the curse.
On the night of the full moon each month, and the nights immediately before and after, the victim suffers a lycanthropic episode lasting from moontise to moonset. During these hours, the victim becomes maddened with a maniacal bloodrage that urges him to commit murder and mayhem against any who cross his path. He is especially attracted to people for whom he feels strong emotion, and these are usually his first victims.
During the bloodrage, the victim's Strength score is increased to an effective 19, he attacks unarmed for 1-2/1-2/1-3 points of damage with his bare hands and teeth, and he gains 2d10 temporary hit points. He is completely feral and likely to attack anything he encounters, While vulnerable only to silver or magical attacks, the victim cannot be magically healed or regain abilities that are refreshed by sleep during the three days of the episode. The victim remembers nothing of the nights in question. The victim is not a true lycanthrope and cannot pass on the curse to his own victims,
At the end of the three-day episode, the victim receives a new saving throw vs. spell with a —3 penalty to break free of the curse. Failure means another episode will occur in the next month. The curse of lycanthropy lasts until the monthly saving throw succeeds, or a wish spell is used to free the victim. A remove curse spell entitles the victim to a new saving throw on the spot to escape the curse, but failure means the caster must gain another level before trying again.
The material component is a drop of blood from a true lycanthrope.
Notes: Very rare, normally employed by evil casters. Known to be in Prismal s Pocket Library, Vol. IX.

Curse of the Gypsies
(Enchantment/Charm)
Reversible
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, an individual is marked as an enemy of the gypsy folk. The caster utters a ritual curse in the tongue of the gypsies while touching the individual, who receives a saving throw vs. spell to resist the mark. Failure means that the curse takes effect with three distinct manifestations.
* Repel Equines: The victim is plagued by a peculiar odor repellent to all equines or quasiequines, including but not limited to horses, donkeys, mules, centaurs, hippogriffs, pegasi, hippocampi, and unicorns. Quasi-equines of low intelligence or higher are hostile toward the marked one, and either flee (75% chance) or attack (25% chance) if the individual approaches within 30 feet. Equines of animal intelligence may refuse to carry the individual, draw a cart or carriage the individual is riding in, or carry the individual's belongings or anything the individual has handled (see Equine Reaction table).

d8	Equine Reaction
1-2	The animal refuses to carry the individual or his belongings.
3-6	The animal can be forced to submit, but if the individual rides, the animal's resistance halves his mounted speed.
7-8	The animal attacks to drive off the offensive individual.

* Bad Luck: The marked one suffers from persistent ill fortune. Once per day, the DM may make a special luck check as the individual attempts an action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a thief ability, or a nonweapon proficiency. The DM rolls 1d20; on a roll of 11 or higher (no modifiers allowed), the action fails miserably. The cursed individual's ill fortune tends to strike at the most inconvenient times.
* Mark of the Gypsies: The creature receives an indelible mark on its forehead. Druids, bards, rangers, and thieves recognize the mark, as do those versed in gypsy lore, although recognition does not necessarily prejudice them against the individual. The mark can be identified by means of a read magic or detect charm spell. All gypsies recognize the mark instantly, and may shun, harass, or attack the outcast to drive him away with all the resources at their disposal.

The curse of the gypsies can be lifted by a remove curse spell. All three effects are undone by the single spell.
The reverse of this spell, blessing ofthe gypsies, causes equine and quasi-equine creatures to be favorably disposed towards the individual. The blessed one can quiet restless equines and urge mounts or pack animals to amazing feats of endurance, increasing their speed or maximum load by 25%. The blessed one gains good luck, which grants him automatic success at one action per day (selected by the DM) on a roll of 11 or higher on a d20. Lastly, the individual receives a blessed mark, Any gypsy to whom the mark is revealed will hold the individual in the highest regard and aid him if at all possible. The blessing of the gypsies lasts for one year.
Notes: Restricted to those of gypsy blood, including related peoples such as the Vistani of the RAVENLOFT setting; common.

Curse Tablet
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 2 days/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This is the most common spell used by evil wizards to kill by means of magic. The caster writes the name of his victim ona lead tablet, drives a nail through the tablet, invokes the spirits of the dead, and places the tablet within an occupied tomb.
Every midnight thereafter, the victim must roll a saving roll vs. spell. Failure means he suffers horrible dreams of his own death and awakens sick and exhausted, having lost half his current hit points (round fractions down) or 1 hit point, whichever is greater. If he succeeds, there is no effect. If he succeeds three times in a row, the curse is broken, the writing on the tablet vanishes, and that particular caster cannot use a curse tablet against him for one year.
The spell can be safely negated by finding the tablet (it radiates magic and evil) and castinga breaking the tablet also breaks the curse, but this inflicts 1d4 points of damage upon the victim.
Notes: Restricted to evil spellcasters; uncommon for witches and necromancers; otherwise rare.

Cursed Image — Hishna
(Evocation, Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 10 mi,/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: 5 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg. or
This spell allows the caster to inflict punishment and damage upon a target creature that is some distance away.
The caster must first make a small, clay image of his victim. The caster must know the general whereabouts of the target, as well as be familiar with his appearance—though the caster need not have seen the target himself, if others provide a detailed description. The molding process is the casting time of the spell.
After the object is complete, the caster (only) can manipulate the image, and inflict damage upon the target. If he holds it tightly, the victim is immobilized, unless he makes a saving throw vs. spell. A successful save allows the individual 1 round of movement, but he must save against the effects of the cursed image on each and every round.
If the caster pummels or pounds the piece, he can inflict 1d10 points of damage per round, though a saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage to half. He cannot damage the image and hold it immobile in the same turn,
The material component of the spell is the clay image. If a tiny bit of hair, skin, nail clippings, etc., of the victim can be incorporated into the image, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to all of his saving throws.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of hishna magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Cyclone Chariot
(Conjuration)
(Air)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 rd_/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell calls forth a whirlwindlike force of great strength. The cyclone chariot forms beneath the feet of the wizard and up to eight other mansized creatures, lifting them up to a height no greater than 20 feet.
From there, the wizard mentally controls the chariot, moving in any direction desired at a rate of 48 (MC: E), as long as the terrain is relatively flat and open. Across mountainous or rough terrain, movement is reduced to 18; in woodland tertain, movement slows to 12. The chariot can cross such obstacles as pits, chasms, ravines, bodies of water, and so forth, floating level with the last solid surface it touched until reaching solid ground again.
Any missile lighter than a boulder hurled at the chariot's occupants is blown aside by its cyclonic winds (spells such as magic missile are unaffected). Physical attacks against the occupants are possible only to flyers and those whose weapons are long enough to reach; such attacks are made at a —3 penalty. The chariot itself is immune to physical attack.
The chariot is an effective weapon. It can make a cyclonic attack if it moves at a rate of6 or less. Any creature with 4 Hit Dice or less caught in its path must save vs. death magic or be swept away and killed. Any creature smaller than huge size (size H) must save vs. paralysis or be drawn into the cyclone and buffeted for 1d4 rounds, then thrown 10d10 feet in a random direction, taking 10%~-100% of its total hit points in damage (1d10 x 10%). A creature surviving being thrown must again save vs. paralysis upon landing to avoid being stunned for 2d4 rounds. Creatures of huge size or larger are attacked as if the chariot was a 16 Hit Die monster, with successful attacks inflicting 2d10 points of damage
The spellcaster cannot attack with spells while mentally controlling the chariot, though magical device use is possible. Those with the caster can use missile weapons at a -3 penalty, and can make physical attacks without penalty upon any foe they can reach. Spellcasters other than the wizard controlling the cyclone chariot can cast spells as if on a stable platform.
Notes: Rare for Air mages, Storm mages, and Weather mages; otherwise very rare. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Daltim's Fiery Protector
(Enchantment, Conjuration/Summoning)
(Fire)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
This spell is usually cast on an object, sometimes a spellbook, that the caster wishes to protect. Daltim's fiery protector summons and imprisons an unintelligent and very minor fire elemental to guard the object. Much like the 4thlevel fire trap spell, Daltim fiery protector can be placed on any closable item, such as a book, box, door, or chest. No other closure or warding spells can be placed on the item; if such is attempted, both spells fail.
Special markings must be made on the affected item, so it can be detected by thieves (and others able to detect traps) with normal chances for detection, The item also radiates heat. Those attempting to remove the trap (by affecting the markings) have only half the normal chance to succeed; failure sets off the spell immediately. A thief who successfully disarms the trap frees the imprisoned elemental, which might attack before fleeing. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not cause the spell to go off, while a successful dispel causes the spell to dissipate and return the imprisoned elemental harmlessly to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
The caster can use the trapped object without activating the guardian. The caster might also establish a password that can be used by others to allow safe access to the object, If the object is opened by anyone else, the spell is activated, and the object's guardian is released to attack the transgressor. The fiery protector is similar to the weak elemental summoned by a dust devil spell; it has 2 HD, AC 4, and can be hit by normal weapons. The fiery protector can attack once per tound, inflicting 1d4 points of damage on a successful strike. The elemental can move at a rate of 18 and sets fire to any flammable object it touches, including opponents it hits or any flammable item that hits it. The guardian attempts to Kill or drive away the individual who tried to open the protected object. It will not move more than 120 yards from the object to which it is bound. If the elemental is killed, the spell is ended. OtherWise, the creature stays active until the offending individual is killed or goes away, at which time it returns to its imprisonment with the item, ready to attack the next individual who attempts to open the item.
During casting, the caster must mark the protected item, making a small symbol that serves asthe prison for the fiery protector. The material components include sulphur, which is sprinkled onto the object, and a ruby worth at least 500 gp. The gem is used to lure the fire elemental into its prison and is consumed during casting.
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in Daltim's Tome of Fire.

Daltim's Flaming Fist
(Evocation)
(Fire)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 fist
Saving Throw: None
Daltim's trademark, this spell produces a fiery fist about the same size as a normal human fist. The fist appears in midair within 10 yards, anywhere the caster desires. Within limits, the caster controls the fist for the duration of the spell.
The fist must stay within 60 yards of the caster but can be made to go anywhere within that area, easily crossing the entire area as the caster wills. Once per round, the caster can either touch an inanimate object with the fist or direct the fist to strike an opponent.
If a flammable object is touched by the fist, a successful saving throw vs. magical fire is required or the item burns.
If the caster attacks with the fist (foregoing any other attack that round), an attack roll is made as if the caster himself was making the attack. If the attack roll is successful, Daltim's flaming fist strikes the opponent and bursts into a 3-foot radius sphere of fire, centered on the point of impact and engulfing the target, which suffers 1d4+1 points of damage.
If the fist misses, its damage potential is stored, to be released on the next successful attack. Thus, if the fist misses once, then hits, it causes 2d4+2 points of damage; if it misses twice and then hits, it causes 344+3 points of damage, and so forth. If the spell's duration runs out before any successful attacks are made, any stored damage potential is released in a fiery burst with a 3-foot radius, centered on the fist's present location. Any creature caught in that radius must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or take the damage stored in the spell (1d4+1 for each round it missed up to that point).
If the caster stops concentrating on the fist, it continues to attack its last target each round until the spell's duration runs out. If the fist's last direction was not to attack, then it remains in place, possibly setting fire to anything that touches it.
The spell's material component is a glove made to fit the caster. A pinch each of sulphur and phosphorus must be placed inside the glove; all components are destroyed upon casting.
This spell is not to be confused with MalecKeth's flame fist from the Tome of Magic.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in Daltim's Tome of Fire.

Daltim's Proof Against Fire
(Abjuration)
(Fire)
Level: 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 object, 1 cu. ft-/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell grants immunity to fire to the object on which it is cast. The protected object cannot be burned by any means. The caster can affect up to one cubic foot of material per caster level; thus, a 14th-level wizard can protect an item with up to 14 cubic feet of mass. Only solid objects can be affected by the spell. The item affected remains cool to the touch.
If Daltim's proof against fire is cast upon an item large enough to be worn (such asa suit of armor or a cloak), that item can be used as protection against normal fires, granting immunity to the effects of any normal flame that is blocked by the item when it is worn. The individual wearing the item also receives a +2 to any saving throws against magical fire.
The material component is an ink made of red dragon blood and a crushed ruby of 5,000 gp value. Protective runes are brushed onto the item before casting the spell; these fade and disappear when the spell is cast.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in Daltim's Tome of Fire.

Damage Mirror — Old Empire
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Special (one use)
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell is the bane of those who like to melee wizards. If a damage mirror spell is active, the wizard is not protected against attack, butif the wizard is struck by a weapon, there is a sound of shattering glass, and every creature attacking the wizard and within a 10-foot radius suffers an identical amount of damage. Thus an archer firing at range against a wizard is not be affected, but a swordsman 10 feet away from the wizard is.
The spell is canceled once it has been triggered; if the opponents have multiple attacks in that melee round, only the first successful attack triggers the damage mirror spell. This spell is not affected by spells or magical attacks, except for dispel magic, which has a normal chance of negating it. If not triggered, it lasts for 1 round per level of the caster,
If the caster is endangered by a special melee attack from an assassin that could slay him instantly, the assassin can roll a Dexterity check to realize the nature of the wizard's protection and avod striking a fatal blow. Otherwisea fatal blow to the wizard kills the assassin instantly.
The material component for this spell is crushed glass from a broken mirror.
Notes: Very rare spell. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requiresa mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Dance Macabre
(Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None
The dance macabre spell causesa single dead body, no more than twice the caster's mass, to animate, moving like a marionette according to the caster's wishes. The body's crude and clumsy movements do not allow it to attack, nor to per form precise or delicate actions. However, it can lift and drop heavy objects with both hands.
The corpse has 18 hit points and an Armor Class appropriate to its clothing or armor. A turning attempt successful against zombies dispels this enchantment, causing the corpse to drop to the ground.
Many necromancers use dance macabre to animate a fallen member of a group of hostile creatures, The DM might require a morale check to determine if the creatures flee in fear.
The spell's material component is a drop of blood.
Notes: Common for necromancers; otherwise very rare.

Dancing Blade
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 10 ft.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd,
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 sword
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the wu jen to animate any nonmagical sword, causing it to spring into the air of its own volition, hover, and fight for the one designated by the caster.
The sword must be usable by the protected individual's character class, and cannot be a sword in the possession of another. The sword always stays within 5 feet of the individual and should that character be slain, the sword drops to the ground. Controlling the sword requires no concentration and the protected individual can fight with another weapon at the same time. The sword has the same number of attacks and chance to hit as the protected individual. It inflicts normal damage, not gaining any Strength bonuses the designated individual may have.
The material component for this spell is a tiny stick puppet waved in the direction of the individual to be protected.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; very rare elsewhere.

Dancing Fire — Phaerimm
(Evocation)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1d6 + 3 rds.
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a flashing, leaping, semicircular, horizontal arc of flame in midair. The arc is 12 feet from end to end, and 2 feet thick. It moves steadily, at a rate of 1, from its point of origin ina direction set at the time ofcasting (and unalterable thereafter), until the spell expires or the arc strikes a solid barrier. If it burns through a bartier, such as a wooden door, the arc continues on in the same direction until spell expiration.
The flames inflict 344 points of damage upon each being they contact, and force saving throws vs. magical fire for all flammable items (cloth, paper, etc.) they touch. Striking a target does not slow or stop the arc; one being cannot shield another from its effects.
Notes: Restricted to Phaerimm; common.

Dancing Lights
(Alteration)
(Fire)
Level: 1
Range: 40 yds. + 10 yds/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When a dancing lights spell is cast, the wizard creates, at his option, from one to four lights that resemble either torches or lanterns (and cast that amount of light), glowing spheres of light (such as evidenced by will-o-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely manlike shape, somewhat similar to that of a creature from the Elemental Plane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the spellcaster desires, forward or back, straight or turning corners, without concentration upon such movement by the wizard. The spell cannot be used to cause blindness (see the Ist-level /ight spell), and it winks out if the range or duration is exceeded.
The material component of this spell is either a bit ofphosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Dancing Shadows
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
(Shadow)
Level: 2
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 30-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
Upon casting this spell, the wizard creates a dancing pattern of flickering lights and shadows in the area of effect. All creatures in the area must save vs. spell or be disoriented while there and for two rounds after leaving the area. Disoriented creatures suffer a ~2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and proficiency checks. Missile attacks made into or through the area are also penalized. Those with the blind-fighting nonweapon proficiency suffer half the penalty, while creatures that do not rely on vision ignore the dancing shadows completely.
A thief who successfully saves gains a +20% bonus to thethief hide in shadows ability while in the area of the dancing shadows, to a maximum of 99%.
Notes: Uncommon for illusionists and shadow mages; otherwise rare. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Dancing Weapon — Alhoon
(Alteration)
Level. 4
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 7 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 weapon
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to animate a single weapon to fly about (at MV Fl 27, MC A) and attack a single target being by itself. The foe must be visible to the caster during casting. Thereafter, the caster can cast other spells or turn his attention to other tasks.
The weapon always hits. Each round, the victim and the weapon roll 1d20. If the weapon roll is higher, the weapon does its maximum damage; if the rolls are equal, roll for damage in the normal way; if the victim's roll is higher, roll again: an even result means the weapon does 2 points of damage, and an odd result means it does 1 point of damage.
During the spell, the weapon is AC —1, and has 44 hit points. It has no sentience, and can't be affected by mind-controlling spells. It cannot strike at the caster or at the wrong target: it only attacks the target chosen during casting, and can't switch targets (if the target flees out of range, dies, or otherwise escapes, the spell ends). The caster can end the spell in an instant, by silent act of will. It also ends if the weapon is destroyed by spell or by hit point loss.
This spell won't work on magical weapons (weapons bearing a permanent dweomer). It will work on an otherwise normal weapon that has had a temporary spell cast on it, but consumes such a weapon when the spell ends or is stopped.
If a tool or handy item is used insteadof a fashioned weapon, a hand-held item causes 1d4 points of damage, a shovel or other tool with a shaft causes 1d6 points of damage, and anything larger than the volume of a large man can't be moved by the spell (wasting the spell). The largest items that can be animated by this spell include such objects as a barrel, a high stepstool, a suit of armor strapped to a rack, a small boat anchor, a two-wheeled pushcart, and the like—typically these cause 2d4 points of damage; never more than 2d6.
The material components of this spell are the wing of an insect or the feather of a bird. The required weapon is consumed only if it has been temporarily enchanted.
Notes: Restricted to alhoon (undead illithid); common.

Dark Mirror
(Abjuration, Alteration)
(Shadow)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd_/level or special
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
The caster chooses to do one of three things at the instant of casting. 1) prevent magical darkness from forming around himself, 2) reflect an incoming magical darkness effect back upon its source (up to 10 yards per level distant), or 3) allow himself to see perfectly in or through any darkness, up to 10 feet per level (this effect lasts one turn per level).
The only time a saving throw applies to this spell is when darkness is to be reflected back upon a source creature. In this case, a successful saving throw vs. spell by the source creature causes the magical darkness to pass out of existence; failure means the darkness is centered directly on its own caster. Note that if the caster of dark mirror chooses to reflect darkness back at the original source, but not directly upon the specific source creature, then no save is allowed; the darkness is stationary and a mobile being can leave the area freely.
Once cast, dark mirror remains in effect and can either prevent the formation of or reflect back multiple darkness effects (even several in the same round) until the spell expires.
The material components of this spell are a small mirror and a candle, which need not be lit.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in The Arcanabula of Jume.

Dark Wings — Drow
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration. 1 rd_/level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell transforms a piece of bat wing and a piece of bone into a short-lived, magicallyassisted pair of giant bat wings. These powerful appendages have a 15-foot tip-to-tip span, and sprout from the shoulders of the caster or one who is touched by him (who must save to negate the spell, even if willing).
The wings allow the affected being to fly clumsily (MV Fl 15, MC:D), but with great power. With these wings, a being can slow a fall, carry companions or gear of up to twice his normal body weight, or glide to bring up to three times the winged being's normal body weight to a harmless landing.
In flight, the wings can buffet other creatures for 2d4 damage per round (slowing flight to 6 per round), and can be used to shield the winged creature and others, giving them the wings' AC of 4 if desired. The wings can take any amount of damage without collapsing or harming their owner. They slow walking movement rate to a maximum of 6, however, dragging behind the being on which they have grown. They cannot be removed before the spell expires, even by the caster, without the use of dispel magic or polymorph magics.
Notes: Restricted to drow; uncommon.

Darkbolt — Alhoon
(Evocation)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster, creates 2 tentacles
Saving Throw: Special
This spell causes a black, rubbery tentacle to spring from each of the caster's hands. These eel-like members leap through the air at up to two targets of the caster's choice up to 30 feet away, striking with the caster's THAC0 and a +3 attack roll bonus.
If a tentacle misses, it wriggles back to the caster during the next round, and then can be hurled again in the third round (by act of will; the caster can cast other spells or take other actions during the second round). Ifa tentacle hits, the victim takes damage equal to 1d4 hit points, plus 1 point per level of the caster. Further, the victim must save vs. spell.
If the save succeeds, the tentacle inflicts 1d4 points of damage upon the victim on the next round and fades away forever.
If the save fails, the victim takes double damage and is constricted by the tentacle, which inflicts 2d4 points of damage per round thereafter until the spell expires or the victim gets free (whereupon the tentacle fades away). Each round, apply tentacle damage, and then roll 1420 for the tentacle and the victim; if the victim's result is higher, he has torn free. Once a tentacle hits, it cannot change to another target.
The material component of this spell is the whole or partial body of a dead worm or snake, a piece of octopus or squid tentacle, or part of a roper's strand or a pseudopod from a mimic or other creature able to extrude appendages.
Notes: Restricted to alhoon (undead illithids); common.

Darkness, 15' Radius
(Alteration)
(Shadow)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds,/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 tun + 1 rd/level
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes total, impenetrable darkness in the area of effect. Infravision is useless. Neither normal nor magical light works unless a light or continual light spell is used. In the former event, the darkness spell is negated by the light spell, and vice versa.
The material components of this spell are a bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

A third-level variant of the darkness spell is thought to exist, developed by drow. It is immobile, centered on the caster's location, and lasts for one turn per level.

Darkning Bolt
(Evocation)
(Shadow)
Level: 4
Range: 180 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Bolt 60 ft. long x 5 ft. wide
Saving Throw: 4
This spell creates a bolt of "negative lightning." This bolt is so black that anyone seeing it has a 10% chance of going blind for 1d4 turns. Black sparks and tendrils of darkness play about the bolt for the brief instant it exists. The bolt starts up to 180 yards away from the caster and extends 60 feet farther. All creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (to a maximum of 10d6). A saving throw vs. spell for half damage is allowed. If the darkning bolt strikes a solid surface (such asa wall), it bounces back toward the caster until the total length of the bolt is 60 feet.
The material component is an onyx rod and a bit of black fur.
Notes: Uncommon for shadow mages; otherwise very rare. (Updated from DUNGEON Magazine.)

Darksense
(Alteration)
(Shadow)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, 8, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When a wizard confers the power of a darksense spell, the recipient gains the ability to transmit and hear high-pitched sounds, as many bats do. This gives the creature a clear "picture" of the physical area that surrounds him, to a distance of 120 feet. For the duration of the darksense spell, the affected creature suffers no penalties for being in darkness or light. The creature may be blind, though he must close his eyes in order to use the darksense if he is not.
Colors are not perceived, nor are variations in heat levels or distinctions between light and dark. Thus some actions, such as the reading of scrolls, are not possible while the creature is under the influence of a darksense spell. The creature is unable to detect any visual illusions, colored gases, clouds of dust or mist, mirror images, insubstantial beings such as certain undead, etc. Insubstantial or noncorporeal beings can attack as if the creature was blind, gaining +4 bonus to hit. This spell does not function (treat as blinded) in a silenced area,
The caster can end the spell with a word at any time before it expires.
The creature does not need any other sensory organs besides his mouth and ears (being gagged or having plugged ears prevents effective use of this spell).
The spell requires two bats ears and a small silyer tuning fork, which must be rung audibly upon completion of the spell's casting. None are consumed by casting the spell.
Notes: Rare spell. Known to be in Manor's Manual of Sight. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Darsson's Cooling Breeze
(Alteration, Evocation)
(Air)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 4 hrs,/level
Area of Effect: 5-ft./level diameter
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a less powerful but longer lasting version of the gust of wind spell. The caster can place the effect on an object or at a specific point. When cast, the air about this point moves slowly clockwise around the center. The air movement will not move faster than 5 mph, about the same asa ceiling fan, and is far too weak to move a sailing ship, for example. This spell can be used to keep air moving in an enclosed place, making a stifling room more comfortable. Richer citizens of Halruaa often cool their homes by means of this spell. It works well when combined with large blocks of ice, which can be purchased from enterprising wizards who use the wall of ice spell.
The material component of the spell is a dried legume.
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in Darsson's Notebook.

Darsson's Eye in the Sky
(Alteration)
(Air)
Level: 4
Range: 5 yds/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 3 rds.
Area of Effect: 10-ft. diameter circle
Saving Throw: None
By use of this spell, a form of programmed levitation, a wizard causes all people and loose objects within the area of effect to move upwards to a desired height, rotate once, and return to the ground. The maximum height is 10 yards per caster level, to a limit of 100 yards. The upward journey requires one round. Objects reaching that height then circle the vertical axis of the spell like a merry-go-round, taking one round for a full circle (any object or person at the center of the upper circle simply rotates in place). After one rotation, all affected objects descend and land gently by the end of the third round.
All affected objects rise and fall at the same rate and maintain their relative positions to one another. If the height desired by the caster is solidly blocked, as by a ceiling, the objects will rise as far as they can, and stop gently just before impact. Normally, to be affected, an object must fit entirely within the area of effect, but a single object larger than the area of effect can be lifted by this spell, also. The spell allows anyone in the area of effect to rise into the air, visually scout the area, and return safely to the ground.
The material component is the eye of a bird.
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in Darssons Notebook.

Darsson's Fiery Cube
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 10-ft. cube
Saving Throw: 4
The fiery cube is an explosive burst of flame that fills an area no larger than a 10-foot cube. It detonates with a low roar, creating a cube of fire. The fire inflicts 1d4 points of damage per level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 10d4.
The fiery cube will fill any open space in its area of effect but does not expand beyond that area. Thus, if it were cast in a corridor 5 feet wide and 7 feet high, it would fill a volume of 10 x 7 x 5 feet.
The caster points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which he wishes to place the spell's center. A streak of orange light flashes from the pointing finger, detonating in cubic shape at the prescribed place unless it strikes a solid object before reaching that place (early impact indicates an early detonation). Creatures in the area of effect that make a saving throw vs. spell take only half damage.
Besides causing damage, the spell ignites all combustibles in its area of effect and melts soft metals, Exposed items require a saving throw vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected. Items in the possession of a creature that makes its saving throw are unaffected.
The material component of this spell is a tiny cube of bat guano, a small amount of sulphur, and a flake of phosphorus.
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in Darsson's Notebook.

Darsson's Music Box
(Enchantment)
(Song)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: Variable
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, a wizard can enchant an inanimate object, usually a seashell or small box, to play a magically recorded message or song. The caster can use the spell to save a special song, to play dramatic music when anyone enters his dungeons, or to create a fancy doorbell.
The message recorded can play for up to one turn. To record, the wizard casts the spell and mentally commands the recording to begin any time in the next round. Likewise, the caster can end the recording by mental command before the maximum one turn duration has expired. Any sound made within a radius determined by the caster (up to 30 feet) will be recorded.
Recorded material is played back when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the spellcaster's instructions. Playback can be at any nondamaging volume, determined at the original casting time. Two recordings made of the same musical piece, made at the same time, can be made to respond to the same condition, producing a stereo effect. Most of Darsson's music boxes are set to respond when the name of a recorded piece is spoken, but they can be set with any trigger, general or specific. Some examples are "when anyone knocks on this door" or "when the king enters the throne room." Another possibility is "when one or more halflings enter the larder." Cues must be audible or visual in nature. The trigger cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, levels, Hit Dice, or classes, except by external garb.
Recordings of spellcasting and command words will not actually cast spells or cause magical items to function. A recording can be used to trigger a magic mouth or other spell that requires. a specific condition to be met (such as Darsson': music box), provided the condition specifiesa recorded message as a trigger.
The material component for the spell is a pearl or a small cube of brass, which is placed inside the ornately carved box, polished seashell, or other fine object on which the dweomer isto be placed.
Notes: Rare or very rare. Known to be in Darsson's Notebook.

Darsson's Potion
(Enchantment)
(Alchemy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 vial of water
Saving Throw: None
This spell prepares a vial of water to accept another spell, allowing the caster to make an "instant" and temporary potion without going through the steps normally associated with making one.
The spell's material component is a vial containing at least one ounce of water; the water must be reasonably clean but need not be pure. The caster must touch the vial of water while casting Darsson's potion. Immediately afterward, the wizard (or another spellcaster) must cast another spell, directed at the vial of water, using all that spell's normal components. Rather than having its normal effect, this second spell is absorbed into the water, creating a temporary potion that can be imbibed any time during the duration of the Darsson's potion spell. The second spell then takes effect on the imbiber as if the spell itself were cast on the imbiber (but never as if the imbiber were the caster).
The spell cast into Darsson's potion must be 3rd level or lower and must be one a caster could and would cast on himself or herself. For example, feather fall, shield, or cure light wounds could be cast into Darsson's potion because they affect the caster directly. Spells like friends, idenlif, shocking grasp, or fireball cannot be cast into Darsson's potion because those are spells that the caster would always use to affect an object or another person. If a question arises, the DM decides whether or not the spell functions.
The secondary spell stored in Darsson's potion has standard effects according to the level and ability of the spellcaster who placed it into the elixir.
Notes: Uncommon or rare for enchanters or alchemists; rare or very rare for others. Known to bein Darsson 's Notebook.

Dauntra's Cloak
(Necromancy)
(Alchemy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell protects the recipient against all known venoms and poisons (including poisonous gases, but not choking smoke or other physical airborne dangers) in the caster or another being touched during casting. Despite its name, the spell is not a visible aura, shield, or cloak, but an internal body state that automatically negates any poison coming into contact with it—allowing a being who knows he'll face poison to prepare for it beforehand.
The spell duration is based on the caster's level. The spell is thought to be effective on all mammalian creatures, and it requires a human hair and at least two drops of a known (liquid) poison in its casting.
Notes: Rare or very rare spell. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Dazzle — Red Wizard

Level: 2
Range: 10 yds. + 10 yd/level

Dead Man's Eyes
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
Dead man's eyes is a deadly necromantic attack. It causes the whites of the caster's eyes to turn black and his pupils to reshape themselves into small white skulls. The caster can affect one victim per round, providing the creature is within 30 feet of the caster and meets his gaze. The gaze attack is in addition to other actions by the caster.

* Creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer (or 2nd level or lower) instantly die. No saving throw is allowed,
* Creatures with 2* to 5 Hit Dice (or 3rd to Sth level) instantly die unless they save vs. death magic at a -2 penalty. Those who succeed in their saving throws suffer 2d6 points of damage.
* Creatures with 5* Hit Dice or more (6th level or greater) suffer 2d6 points of damage unless they save vs. death magic.

If the caster's gaze is reflected back on him (by a mirror, calm water, etc.), he must make a saving throw vs. spell or suffer the effects. When the spell ends, the caster has a 5% chance to become blind for the next 5 to 10 hours (1d6+4).
The material components for this spell are two eyeball-sized glass marbles. The marbles must be the same color as the caster's eyes.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Deafness
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
The deafness spell causes the recipient to become totally deaf and unable to hear any sounds. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. An affected creature has a —1 penalty to its surprise rolls unless its other senses are unusually keen. Deafened spellcasters have a 20% chance to miscast any spell with a verbal component. This deafness can be done away with only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the spellcaster.
The material component of this spell is beeswax.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Death Armor
(Abjuration, Necromancy)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
This spell surrounds the caster with a crackling black aura that injures any creature that comes into contact with it. Once the caster activates the spell's protection, any creature that strikes the wizard with bare hands or its own natural weapons must make a saving throw vs. death magic. Failure means the creature suffers 246 points of damage. The wizard sustains full damage from any successful attack.
Most normal animals and any monster attacking without weapons are subject to this spell, including humanoid creatures that choose to grapple, pummel, or overbear the caster. Weapons and ranged attacks inflict damage on the caster normally. Any number of creatures can be affected by the death armor, suffering the effect for each attack they make. Animal and semiintelligent creatures, if they attack at all, will usually abort a multiple-attack routine when they first take damage.
The death armor spell is a passive defense; the wizard himself must save against its effects if he tries to grasp or grapple an enemy. The spell ends after 1 round per caster level. A caster slain while wearing the death armor is engulfed in a burstof black energy; his next resurrection survival check is made at a -20% penalty.
Preparations: Any time within 8 hours of casting this spell, the wizard must spend two full rounds anointing his garments and body witha rare unguent worth at least 300 gp. Once the wizard has coated himself, the death armor can then be invoked at any time in the next 8 hours with@ casting time of 2. If the wizard does not activate the spell's protection during this time, the unguent is expended with no effect.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Death Bump — Ghul
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
The death bump is a spell generally used by ghul lords; and is a mixed blessing. It allows an individual receiving fatal damage in the round prior to its casting to return to life. However, it transfers all that damage from the victim to another nearby target individual (friend or foe alike).
When the spell is successfully cast, the recently dead (or dying) character rises to life in the following round with 1d6 hit points. These hit points are subtracted from total damage taken by the character in the round of death, and the remaining hit points are transferred to the target individual and subtracted from his hit point total.
The target individual doesn't have to be willing. An unwilling target is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic. If the saving throw is successful, the slain individual remains dead and the target individual suffers no damage. In this case, the ghul lord is instantly revealed as the caster ofthe spell, asa grayish nimbus of dim light surrounds him for several moments after the spell has been cast.
Notes: Common for ghul lords; very rare in arabian settings; otherwise unknown.

Death Fog
(Alteration, Evocation)
(Air, Alchemy)
Level: 6
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1d4 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Two 10-ft. cubes/level
Saving Throw: None
The casting of a death fog spell creates an area of solid fog that has the additional property of being highly acidic. The vapors are deadly to living things, so that vegetation exposed to them will die—grass and similar small plants in two rounds, bushes and shrubs in four, small trees in eight, and large trees in 16 rounds. Animal life not immune to acid suffers damage according to the length of time it is exposed to the vapors of a death fog, as follows:

1st round: 1 point
2nd round: 2 points
3rd round: 4 points
4th and each succeeding round: 8 points

The death fog otherwise resembles the 2ndlevel fog cloud spell: rolling, billowing vapors that can be moved only by a very strong wind. Any creature attempting to move through the death fog progresses at a rate of 1 foot per unit of normal movement rate per round. A gust of wind spell cannot affect it, but a fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire can burn it away in a single round.
The material components are a pinch of dried and powdered peas, powdered animal hoof, and strong acid of any sort (including highly distilled vinegar or acid crystals), which must be obtained from an alchemist.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Death Link
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 240 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
Also called body sympathy, this spell puts the wizard and a target creature in a two-way sympathetic link. Any damage inflicted on the wizard is automatically inflicted on the linked creature as well; should the caster die, so too will the linked creature. Conversely, if the linked creature is damaged or hurt, the caster will be hurt as well.
Saving throws, ability checks, and Armor Class are considered those of the individual attacked—only the effect is carried over to the partner in the death link. The only exception is that if the linked creature dies, the caster survives unless enough points of damage have been received through the link to prove fatal. Both curative and destructive spells cross the link— healing one party heals the other.
Once cast, the spell cannot be ended by either party until its duration runs out or one or the other party physically leaves the plane of existence the other occupies. Distance between the parties (except at the initial casting) has no effect on this spell.
The death link is occasionally used as a tool of revenge by powerful wizards against individuals weaker than themselves, but it is more often used as a vouchsafe to protect one side or the other in negotiations—if both sides can be hurt bya single act of treachery, then both sides tend to negotiate in better faith.
Notes: Uncommon spell. Known to be in The Alcaister, an ancient tome.

Death Recall
(Divination, Necromancy)
(Mentalism)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect' 1 corpse
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to visualize the final minutes of the life of any creature or person that died within the previous 24 hours. When the caster touches the subject's corpse, the caster goes into a trance. The caster then has a vision of the final 10 minutes of the subject's life as seen by the subject himself. The vision ends with the last scene the subject saw before he died, at which time the caster awakens from his trance and the spell is over.
The material component for this spell is a fragment from a shattered mirror.
Notes: Restricted to diviners, mentalists, and necromancers; uncommon.

Death Sight
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 30 yds.
Components: S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 5 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 being
Saving Throw: Neg.
The victim of this spell sees everyone around him as a walking corpse. A saving throw vs. spell negates the effect. Otherwise, the being must make a RAVENLOFT fear check in the first round. (The victim makes a saving throw vs. paralyzation, adjusted for Wisdom. Failure means victim flees with a 60% chance of dropping held items; flight continues until the threat is outdistanced or evaded, or the spell duration expires. If cornered, defense is possible after a round of hesitation, but at 2 to attack rolls and Armor Class, and the victim is 25% likely to miscast any spell attempted).
If the fear check is passed, the victim must make a RAVENLOFT horror check at the beginning of each of the next four rounds of the spell's duration. (The victim makes saving throws vs. paralyzation, adjusted for Wisdom. Failure means some long-term effects apply: see table.) Once the spell duration ends, no more horror checks are necessary, though the results of a failure lasta full month.
The DM decides if and how characters can shorten long-term effects. Use of the forget spell and successfully facing down similar fears might help. The DM is encouraged to reward creative solutions.
Notes: Uncommon in the RAVENLOFT setting; otherwise rare.

1d4	Horror Result
1	Aversion
2	Senseless Rage
3	Mental Shock
4	Fearstruck

Aversion: The character must avoid undead or be fearstruck automatically. In the open, a minimum distance of 30 feet must be maintained. Indoors, the character cannot bear to be in the same room with the undead, and has around to leave or be fearstruck. Aversion persists for a month.
Fearstruck: This is just like failing a fear check (see above); the character flees, possibly (60%) dropping held items, Further, for the next month, whenever the character confronts undead, he must save vs. paralysis at -2 or flee immediately.
Mental Shock: The character is stunned for 3 rounds, then can save vs. paralysis each round to recover. If three saving throws in a row are failed, the character goes into deep shock, and one attempt to recover is allowed each hour. The general condition lasts a month; during this time, whenever undead are encountered, the character must save vs. paralysis at —2 or go into mental shock again.
Senseless Rage: When confronted by undead, the character must berserkly try to smash them and anything that gets in his path to them. Double attacks are made at +2 to hit and damage. If the undead are destroyed, the character carries on as if they weren't. Starting round 4 and on even-numbered rounds, a saving throw vs. paralysis is allowed to return to normal. The tendency to fly into these rages lasts for a month, New meetings with undead require a saving throw vs. paralysis at -2 or the senseless rage takes over.

Death Smoke
(Evocation)
(Province: Wind)
Level: 5
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Id4 + 1 rds.
Area of Effect: 20-ft radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2
This spell creates a dark, billowing, noxious cloud that cannot be burned or blown away. Those trapped in the cloud fight as if in total darkness (even creatures with infravision, ultravision, or echo-location). In addition, they suffer 6d4 points of damage for each round of contact, unless they have no need to breathe (e g., undead or nonliving things) or are protected in some manner vs. poisons. When the spell duration ends, the smoke fades harmlessly away.
Like the fifth-level cloudkill spell, the death smoke is heavier than air. It seeks the lowest lev- els, flowing down stairs and into burrows.
Although it cannot be affected by natural or magical winds, the smoke can be deterred by physical objects in its path (such as a stone wall, or a wall of iron spell). If cast underwater, this spell causes a harmless burst of vapor that rolls water away for one round.
The material components of death smoke are a crushed insect or arachnid, plus a pinch of sand. Both are consumed by the casting.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; very rare elsewhere.

Death Spell
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 30-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: None
When a death spell is cast, it snuffs out the life forces of creatures in the area of effect instantly and irrevocably. Such creatures cannot be raised or resurrected, but an individual slain in this manner might be brought back via a wish. The number of creatures that can be slain is a function of their Hit Dice.

Creatures' Hit Dice	Maximum # of Creatures Affected
Under 2			4d20
2 to 4			2d20
4+1 to 6+3		2d4
6+4 to B43		1d4
6+4 to B43		1d4

If creatures of differing Hit Dice are attacked with a death spell, roll the dice (4d20) to determine how many creatures of under 2 Hit Dice are affected, If the number rolled is greater than the —_actual number of sub-2 Hit Dice creatures, apply the remainder of the roll to the higher Hit Dice creatures by consulting the following table.

Creatures' Hit Dice	Conversion Factor (CF)
Under 2			1
2 t0 4 			2
4+1 to 6+3		10
6+4 to 8+3		20

In other words, from the 4d20 roll subtract the number of creatures of less than 2 Hit Dice (these creatures die). If there are any remaining points from the 4420 roll, subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit Dice (these creatures also die). If this still doesn't use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 for each creature of 4+1 to 6+3 Hit Dice, and so on. Stop when all the creatures are dead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the remainder is less than half the CF of any remaining creatures. (If the remainder is one-half or more of the CF of a creature, that creature dies.)
For example, a mixed group of 20 goblins, eight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill giant, are caught in the area of a death spell. The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of this elimi- nates the goblins (20 x 1 CF), 16 kills the gnolls (8 x 2 CF), and the remaining 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one ogre, and the remaining points are enough to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres and the hill giant are unharmed.
A death speil does not affect lycanthropes, undead creatures, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material.
The material component of this spell is a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 1,000 gp.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Death Spider — Drow
(Alteration, Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Special
Area ofEffect: 1 limb
Saving Throw: Neg.
This horrible spell causes one of the victim's own limbs to instantly become a mindless, hairy black spider. The spider twists about and starts eating the victim's flesh, doing 1-2 points of damage per round. Anything worn or carried by that limb drops away.
The victim is allowed an initial save against the spell. If it fails, only a remove curse in tandem with apolymorph spell, or a limited wish or more powerful means, will end the condition. (A dispel magic will be effective onlyif cast within 2 rounds of the touch that confers the death spider condition.) The afflicted limb can be severed and burned to destroy the death spider. If done within a round of its creation, only a hand or foot will be lost (with 1d4+1 points damage, a system shock roll, and the loss of the limb's mobility and abilities). If left until longer, the entire limb will have to go, with the loss of 1d12+4 hit points and a system shock roll.
A death spider has no poisonous bite or other spider powers, but if unchecked it will inexorably consume its entire host.
One day after the host is entirely eaten, the spider will exhibit the webspinning, venom, and other abilities of the spider type it resembles, becoming a giant-sized spider of that type.
The material components of this spell are a small live spider of any sort, a drop of the digestive juices of any creature, and a tooth (from any source).
Notes: Common for drow, who guard it zealously; uncommon for neogi; otherwise very rare.

Death Talisman
(Divination, Enchantment, Necromancy)
(Artifice)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, 8, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 wk./level
Area of Effect: 1 object
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, a caster can enchant a small item, usually a polished knife or other shiny metal object, linking it to the caster's health. As long as the caster stays healthy, the object remains in the same condition as it was in at the time of casting. When the caster dies or is otherwise permanently disabled (for instance, turned to stone), the enchanted object becomes corroded and dull. The divination effect lasts as long as the caster stays within 1,000 miles of the enchanted item.
The material component of the spell is the item to be enchanted, which is not consumed during casting.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Death Ward
(Abjuration, Necromancy)
(Geometry)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 doorway, portal, or small object
Saving Throw: Neg.
By covering a doorway with the most forbidden and lethal of necromantic runes, a wizard can protect a small portal so that any creature that tries to pass through the warded area without first speaking a word of command is immediately subjected to a modified death spell. The ward can be cast on an item (usually a spellbook or phylactery) or on a tunnel or cave entrance no larger than 30 feet in diameter.
Despite its lethality, this is not a subtle warding. The protected area or object is literally covered with intricate, arcane runes and symbols at the time of casting. These glyphs may flash ominously with pale red or blue light when approached within 10 feet. The entire area radiates a magical aura of lethal necromancy.
A single application of this spell can kill up to twice as many Hit Dice or levels of creatures as the wizard who cast the spell has levels of experience (thus a 20th-level wizard can slay up to 40 levels with a single death ward). Each creature passing through the ward is entitled to a saving throw vs. death magic with a —4 penalty; if successful, the individual survives and the ward loses none of its lethality. However, those who fail their saves are immediately slain (as per a death spell) and their levels or Hit Dice are subtracted from the potency of the ward. Those with greater Hit Dice than the current power of the death ward are unaffected by the spell.
For example, an 18th-level lich has cast the death ward (which can slay up to 36 levels) on the entrance to her inner sanctum. A party of four characters, each 15th level, enter her lair and foolishly traverse the warding. The first member fails his save and perishes, reducing the ward's effectiveness to 21 levels. The second character makes her save and thus escapes any ill effects (the ward remains unaffected, however). The third character fails the save and dies also, reducing the ward to 6 levels of potency. The fourth 15th-level character has too many levels of experience to be affected by the weakened ward, which remains in effect until drained by a less powerful being.
Provided that he is on the same plane of existence, the caster will be immediately aware if the death ward has been triggered. By concentrating, the wizard who cast the ward can determine its current level of lethality, regardless of distance.
This terrible spell is a closely held secret, guarded jealously by the most powerful and black-hearted of necromancers and liches. It was originally designed by liches, as they can easily sustain the rigors of casting such a spell.
Mortal wizards who employ this powerful spell have a 25% chance of insanity (as per the contact other plane spell), permanent paralysis (viaa stroke), or suffering a terminal illness (as per the cause disease spell) as adjudicated by the DM. The danger is reduced by 5% for every point by which the mortal wizard's Intelligence is above 18, though this chance never drops below 5%. Liches and other undead casters are completely immune to these dangers. It is rumored that certain ancient, evil dragons have developed an even more potent version of this spell, which they can employ in their lairs with impunity.
The material component is a magical ink fabricated exclusively for this spell. The list of the ink's noxious ingredients is lengthy and complex, but it includes the venom of numerous poisonous animals and the acrid ichor of extraplanar fiends. The accumulation of these deadly components and the subsequent fabrication of the ink itself has the same chance as the actual casting of inflicting a baneful result.
While the inscription process (the actual casting) of the death ward takes only1 turn, the fabrication process of the ink (once the proper ingredients have been assembled) takes 1-4 days. The ink also requires the dust of powdered perdiots and garnets, worth between 2,000-8,000 gp.
Notes: Rare spell.

Death's Door
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
Like the third-level priest spell of the same name, death's door works by touch upon a creature "at death's door" (—1 to —9 hit points). The necromancer's version works on any living or undead creature.
The spell brings the touched creatureto 0 hit points and stops bleeding and deterioration for the spell duration (further magical means can restore the creature to a functioning state).
Unlike the priest version, the necromancer must make a system shock check or lose as many hit point as required to bring the creature to 0 hit points. If this would reduce the necromancer below 1 hit point, he is reduced to 1 hit point and rendered unconscious for 1 turn for each hit point he should have, but didn't, lose. The necromancer can end any death 5 door spell that he cast with a command.
The material components of the spell are a clear gem or crystal, a drop of water or dew, a drop of blood, a drop of milk or nectar, and any form of unguent.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; uncommon.

Deathbolt — Old Empire
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell causes a bolt of death energy to strike its target, which may be any living creature native to the Prime Material Plane. When this bolt strikes, the target dies unless it makes a successful saving throw vs. spell. Even if the roll succeeds, the victim suffers 10d6 points of damage.
The material component for this spell is vampire ichor.
Notes: Uncommon. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Deathguard — Old Empire
(Abjuration, Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a guardian spirit from the Ethereal Plane that protects the creature from attacks. The guardian has one function: Should any attack reduce the hit points of the creature it has been assigned to guard to zero or below, the guardian intervenes and suffers the damage instead of the creature, saving the creature from death. Once the guardian saves its master's life it is destroyed.
The creature does not suffer any damage from the attack that would have killed it, be it damage from falling from acliff, dragon breath, or a weapon strike. Note that if the attack doesn't bring the creature to zero hit points or below, the creature takes full damage (the guardian prevents only lethal blows).
Notes: Common. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Deathmaster's Vial
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 or more vials
Saving Throw: None
This spell activates an evil fluid that has been sealed in specially prepared vial, The activated concoction can be hurled as a grenade-like missile. A direct hit inflicts 2d8+3 points of rotting damage. A miss within 5 feet inflicts 1d4+1 points of rotting damage.
The casting activates 1 vial per 3 levels of the caster, up to a total of 5 vials at 15th level. The vials must be used within 2 hours of exposure to direct sunlight, but will last for 2-20 days if kept in darkness. Exposing the liquid to the air after activation destroys it within a round. The vials radiate evil.
Preparation: The base fluid is made from boiling the remains of a ghoul or ghast for 24 hours and adding various noxious substances worth about 300 gp. This yields enough liquid to fill up to 5 small vials (like those used to carry holy/unholy water).
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; rare.

Deathshroud
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, $, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Maximum 2 rds,/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
The deathshroud spell draws upon the Negative Material Plane to surround the caster with a dark and shadowy aura of life-draming energy. While the caster suffers no ill-effects from this baneful radiance, it has dire consequences for anyone else who comes into contact with it. Magical constructs and undead are not harmed by this spell, and cannot activate it.
Once the spell is cast, the wizard can activate the deadly power of the aura by touching a victim, which requires a successful attack roll. A creature successfully touched must immediately save vs. death magic with a —4 penalty. If successful, the creature is unharmed. If the save is failed, a black death haze forms around the creature, draining 20% of its current hit points immediately. At the end every round thereafter, that number of hit points is again drained from the creature.
The deathshroud might also affect a creature that touches the wizard or tries to strike him with any hand-held object. The creature must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic (with no penalty) or be stricken by the death haze effect. The haze effect is not cumulative, a creature is either affected by it or not.
The following spells end the death haze effect: cure critical wounds, heal, limited wish, wish, or a successful dispel magic. Lesser curing spells and healing potions have their normal effect, and also prevent the creature from dropping below 1 hit point in the round they are used—excess damage is ignored.
The deathshroud lasts for two rounds per caster level, or until the shroud has been activated as many times as the caster has levels. The spell can be ended prematurely by killing the caster or successfully employing dispel magic on him. When the spell ends, all death haze effects end immediately.
This dreadful spell is known only to a select cadre of necromancers who purportedly learned it from a mysterious, bronze-bound book of extraplanar origin.
The spell requires the following material components: crushed black opal and diamond (worth 5,000 gp), dust from a corporeal undead with strong ties to the Negative Material Plane (such as a vampire or wight), and a hunk of smoky quartz. These ingredients are consumed in the casting.
Notes: Very rare; known mostly by a few necromancers. Known to be in the Book of Naz. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Decastave
(Evocation)
(Force)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
The material component of this spell is a small piece of wood. When the spell is cast, the wood vanishes and is replaced by a 10-foot-long pole of magical force, 2 inches in diameter. The pole can be wielded only by the caster, and will cease to exist if it leaves his hands or is cut by metal (requires a hit against Armor Class 0).
The pole cannot be shortened from its 10-foot length, or bent. Other creatures can grasp the pole, but only if their total Strength exceeds 18 can they hamper its use or rip it out of the wizard's hands (causing it to dissolve).
The decastave can be wielded as a weapon, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per successful attack. The wizard suffers normal nonproficiency penalties if he does not have weapon proficiency with staves. The decastave is treated as a magical weapon for striking creatures that are immune to normal weapons.
Once per use of the spell the caster can use the decastave can be used to drain a target of 1d4 hit points. This is done in addition to the decastave's normal damage. The caster must determine before rolling to hit whether he will use this power. The drained hit points are channeled into the decastave's wielder, to heal current damage only. If the caster is uninjured, then the drained hit points are lost.
Notes: Uncommon spell. Known to bein Detho's Libram.

Deep Delve
(Alteration)
(Water)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: 4d6 hrs. + 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
Use of this spell causes major changes in the underwater environment around the caster and his companions. These changes improve traveling and fighting conditions underwater for all in the area of effect. When cast, the spell grants the effects of the water breathing spell to all in the area of effect at that instant, dividing its duration between the participants. Each individual affected remains able to breathe underwater for the duration, even if that individual later leaves the area of effect. The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him.
The caster can mentally propel the sphere and its contents through the water at a movement rate of 18. Those transported can move about within the sphere, but those who leave its confines while it is moving risk being left behind to drown. The sphere's movement never causes turbulence of any kind, nor any significant displacement of water outside the sphere. It otherwise leaves all free-floating creatures and objects undisturbed, though sea creatures will tend to avoid entering the sphere. The power to move the sphere cannot be used to harm other creatures. If the sphere comes into contact with any part of the ocean floor (including coral reefs or ship wrecks), it will cease to move until the caster levitates the sphere above such obstacles.
The full concentration of the caster is required to move the sphere; it will hover in place if concentration is broken. Concentration for the purpose of movement can be broken and resumed as often as desired during the duration of the spell.
Vision inside the sphere is also improved according to available light and depth. The spell enhances available natural light and doubles normal visual range for those within its confines, as outlined in the rules for underwater vision (DMG, page 79). For instance, vision at a depth of 30 feet in a freshwater lake is normally reduced to only 30 feet; the deep delve sphere increases visual range to 60 feet. Of course, this power is ineffective at depths dominated by total darkness. The spell does, however, make the lighting of torches, lanterns, candles, and other standard light sources possible underwater. The normal effective range and burning time for fiery light sources are reduced by half. Each torch or lantern lit reduces the maximum duration of the sphere its own duration (for example, a torch normally burning for one hour would last half an hour, but would reduce the duration of the sphere by a full hour.
Lastly, the spell reduces the disadvantages of standard underwater combat by one-half. Spells are still restricted by the normal rules of underwater combat.
The material components for this spell are a piece of straw, a sliver of wood from a sunken ship, and two eyes from any sea creature. The components are mixed in a conch shell, and only the shell can be reused.
Notes: Uncommon for Water or Sea mages; otherwise rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Deepen Shadows — Ninja
(Illusion)
Level: 2
Range: 0 or 6 yds. (see below)
Components: S,
Casting Time: 5 rds.
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: One 10 x 10 ft. area/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell slowly, inconspicuously darkens the room where the ninja is. The change is gradual, taking five rounds.
With a successful saving throw at a —4 penalty, someone inside the room may notice that it is getting darker, but this observation does not affect the spell's progress.
When the spell is completed, the room is as full of shadow and darkness as is possible without arousing suspicion. If it is daylight outside, it will seem that a cloud has passed over the sun.If it is nighttime, the candles and fire seem to have burned low. The dimming of the light does not appear at all menacing to people in the area, though a detect magic will reveal the presence of the deepen shadows spell.
The caster receives a +2% bonus per experience level to his hide in shadows roll within the effect of the deepen shadows spell. Only the caster receives this bonus, because only he has complete understanding of the way the shadows fall.
This spell is useful to a ninja who cannot use his ability to hide in shadows because the area is too bright. The shadows created by this spell can help ninja to escape, to infiltrate, to pull sleightof-hand switches, etc. A ninja in a portal or doorway between rooms can choose which room is darkened by this spell.
A ninja of sufficient level to cover more than the area of the room occupied loses the excess area lost unless: there is an open portal between the ninja's room and an adjacent room, and the ninja's spell can affect enough area to cover both rooms completely.
If the ninja is not of sufficient level to affect the entire area of a room, the spell automatically fails.
Example: Noriko is a 2nd-level spellcaster, and thus can cover a 10-foot by 20-foot area with her deepen shadows spell. However, she is standing in a 20-foot by 20-foot room. If she tries to cast her spell here, it will fail.
Notes: Restricted to ninja spellcasters and those trained by them; common.

Deeppockets
(Alteration, Enchantment)
(Dimension)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 12 hrs. + 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: 1 garment
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the wizard to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far more than it normally could. A finely sewn gown or robe of high-quality material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number. The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (5 cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the caster can instead choose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (‘4 cubic foot volume each). If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and % cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space.
If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful dispel magic is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. The caster can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command.
In addition to the garment, which is reusable, the material components of this spell are atiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth givena half-twist and fastened at the ends.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Deflection — Alhoon
(Abjuration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell protects the alhoon caster for the rest of the round in which it is cast or on the following round (whichever is chosen during casting). During the round the spell lasts, it lessens the effects of any weapon attacks on the caster. The spell does not affect the chances of the caster being hit—only the damage suffered, No saving throw benefits are conferred by the spell.
Attacks are prevented from stunning the caster or severing any part of the caster's body, and physical damage inflicted is reduced by —1 hit point per die, to a minimum of 1 hit point per die. The spell prevails even in "maximum damage" situations, but has no effect against acid, poison, or purely magical attacks. (Magical weapon attacks are lessened, as are missile attacks.)
Delaying the effect until the round after casting, does not impair the casting of a new spell in that round, nor does such casting affect the deflection.
The effects of this spell can be combined with a shield spell or other protective magics, but there is no known way for the caster to aid another being by means of a deflection; it affects only the caster.
The material component of this spell is a piece of nail from the hand or claw of any creature, or a hard piece of chitin or other exoskeleton.
Notes: Restricted to alhoon (undead illithids); common.

Defoliate
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 30 yds.
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 50-ft. square/level
Saving Throw; None
By means of this evil spell, the caster causes all vegetation within the affected area to wither and die, crumbling into black ashes. All vegetation is affected, from the tallest tree to the tiniest blade of grass. Intelligent plant life, such as treants, are also destroyed. The power of a wish or its equivalent is required to restore the destroyed vegetation; otherwise, nothing can grow in the defoliated area for a full year. Casting this spell ages the caster by one year.
Note that since the defoliate dweomer causes plants to crumble to ash, there is no danger of a creature being struck by a toppling tree; however, creatures hiding in trees will find themselves plummeting to the ground when this spell is cast.
The material components for this spell are the petal from a withered flower and a sliver of charred wood.
Notes: Uncommon; usually in the hands of evil necromancers.

DeGras's Pilfering Fingers
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, $
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
Casting the spell lets a wizard add 5% per experience level to the chance of success of any one percentage-based thieving skill chosen at the time of casting. This bonus applies to all attempts to use the skill during the spell's duration. If the caster has no thief abilities, the caster gains one percentagebased skill for the duration of the spell. His score in the newly gained ability is 5% per level with a —10% penalty, and no racial, armor, or Dexterity bonuses apply. The thief skill cannot be raised above 99%. While the spell is in effect, the wizard can cast no spells, although other actions are possible. The caster can end the spell at will.
Notes: Uncommon or rare for multi-class thieves; otherwise rare or very rare.

Delay Death
(Enchantment, Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Maximum 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to postpone the death of one living person or creature. If delay death is cast before the chosen creature reaches 0 hit points, the recipient is able to fight, cast spells, communicate, and take all other normal actions until reaching —10 hit points. When the subject reaches -10 hit points, he is dead and the delay death spell is no longer in effect. Note that the spell has a limited duration; if the spell expires after the affected subject has reached 0 hit points but before he has been reduced to —10 hit points, the subject dies instantly. A deceased subject previously under the effect of delay death can be revived by any method that would normally return the slain character to life.
The material component for this spell is a chip from a tombstone or a sliver of wood from a coffin.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; common.

Delay Image
(Chronomancy)
Reversible
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 5 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
When delay image is cast, the recipient is surrounded by a thin magical aura that bends time slightly, causing the person's image to appear one second behind actual motion. This gives a-2 to the creature's Armor Class, and +1 to saves against direct magical attacks.
This spell can be used in conjunction with other Armor-Class-affecting spells, but it is not cumulative with itself. A saving throw vs. spell is required if the target is unwilling.
The reverse of this spell, advance image, creates a false image half a second ahead of the target. This adds a +1 to its THAC0, as opponents misjudge his blows.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Delayed Blast Fireball
(Evocation)
(Fire)
Level: 7
Range: 100 yds. + 10 yds/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 0 to 5 rds. delay, then instantaneous
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 4
This spell createsa fireball, with a +1 bonus to each of its dice of damage, which releases its blast any time from instantly to five rounds later, according to the command given by the wizard.
The spell inflicts up to 15d6+15 points of damage. In other respects, the spell is the same as the 3rd-level spell fireball.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Delayed Light — Alhoon
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 60 yds.
Components: V, M
Casting Time:
Duration: Until triggered, then 1 turn
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a luminous glow, equal to torchlight. This radiance appears only when specific conditions are met, in the same way as a magic mouth spell is set to be triggered, even if this occurs years after casting. When the light does appear, it lasts for 1 turn, occupying a fixed area 40 feet in diameter.
The area in which the light will appear must be in range and clearly visible to the caster as the spell is cast. When the light appears, it permanently negates magical darkness (either innate ability or spell of up to 3rd level). It can be ended instantly by the caster (if present and within 60 yards) at any time, by silent act of will.
This spell is often used as a silent alarm, alerting the caster or trained guardian creatures to the arrival of an intruder.
The material components of this spell are a spark and pinch of phosphorescent fungus.
Notes: Restricted to alhoon (undead illithids); common.

Delayed Magic Missile
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 80 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
Visually, this spell is nearly identical to the first-level magic missile spell; however, it has several differences: delayed magic missile deals more damage, staggered over a longer time; second and subsequent attacks do not automatically hit; a shield spell does not block the attack.
When cast, darts of magical energy shoot from all of the wizard's fingertips, collecting into one missile just before striking the target creature, which must must be at least partially in sight at the time of the casting. The missile causes 1d6 points of damage for every three levels of the caster (for example a 12th-level caster deals a total of 4d6 points of damage).
The initial impact deals 146 points of damage to the target, and another 1d6 damage strikes each round thereafter until the duration is reached. On each round after the first, the target can attempt a saving throw vs. spell at —2 to dodge damage for that round. If successful, the creature can act normally; failure means the 1d6 points of damage for the round are taken. The staggered attacks do prevent a targeted spellcaster from concentrating on a spell.
Regardless of previous saving throws, the magic remains potent until the duration runs out. For example, an opponent making 11 successful saving throws against this spell as thrown by a 12th-level wizard takes only the initial 1d6 points of damage.
While originally created a decade ago by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and his consort Laeral, this spell has become more widely used in more recent years. Made for the Lords of Waterdeep, the Harpers, and select allies, knowledge of this spell fell into the hands of the Zhentarim and the Knights of the Shield, who spread its use amongst their members as well. While still relatively rare, many wizards seek this spell for its uses against other wizards in spell battles.
Notes: Uncommon spell.

Delude
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of a delude spell, the wizard conceals his own alignment with that of any creature within a 30-foot radius at the time the spell is cast. The creature must be of higher than animal intelligence for the spell to work; its own alignment remains unchanged. The creature receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the delude spell fails. If the spell is successful, any know alignment spell used against the caster discovers only the assumed alignment. Note that a detect good or detect evil also detects the assumed aura, if the aura is strong enough. The creature whose aura has been assumed radiates magic, but the wizard radiates magic only to the creature whose alignment has been assumed. If a delude spell is used in conjunction with a change self or alter self spell, the class of the wizard can be totally hidden, if he is clever enough to carry off the disguise.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Demand
(Evocation, Enchantment/Charm)
(Mentalism)
Level: 8
Range: Unlimited
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is very much like the Sth-level wizard spell sending, allowing a brief contact with a far-distant creature. However, with this spell the message can also contain a suggestion (see the 3rd-level wizard spell suggestion), which the subject will do its best to carry out if it fails its saving throw vs. spell, made with a -2 penalty. Of course, if the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand comes, the message is understood but no saving throw is necessary and the suggestion is ineffective.
The caster must be familiar with the creature contacted and must know its name and appearance well. If the creature in question is not in the same plane of existence as the spellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that the demand does not arrive. Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably at the option of the DM. The demand, if received, will be understood even if the creature has an Intelligence ability score as low as 1 (animal Intelligence). Creatures of demigod status or higher can choose to come or not, as they please.
The demand message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the suggestion. The creature can also give a short reply immediately.
The material components of the spell are a pair of cylinders, each open at one end, connected by a thin piece of copper wire and some small part of the subject creature—a hair, a bit of nail, ete.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Demishadow Magic
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
(Shadow)
Level: 6
Range: 60 yds. + 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to the Sth-level shadow magic spell, but this spell enables the casting of partially real 4th- and Sth-level evocations (cone of cold, wall of fire, wall of ice, cloudkill, etc.). If recognized as demishadow magic (ifa saving throw vs. spell is successful), damaging spells inflict only 40% of normal damage, with a minimum of2 points per die of damage.A demishadow magic cloudkill slays creatures with fewer than 2 Hit Dice and inflicts 1d2 points of damage per round.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Demishadow Monsters
(Mlusion/Phantasm)
(Shadow)
Level: 5
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell is similar to the 4th-level spell shadow monsters, except that the monsters created are effectively 40% of normal hit points. If the saving throw is made, their damage potential is only 40% of normal and their Armor Class is 8. The monsters have none of the special abilities of the real creatures, although victims may be deluded into believing this to be so.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Deny Cold/Deny Fire
(Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell has much the same effect of the Istlevel priest spell endure cold/endure heat, but it acts to repel the extreme, rather than toughen the body. The creature is protected from normal heat or cold (depending on which application the wizard selects at the time of casting). The creature can stand unprotected in temperatures as low as —30° F. or as high as 130° F. (depending on the application) with no ill effect. Temperatures beyond these limits inflict 1 point of damage per hour of exposure for every degree beyond the limit.
The spell is immediately cancelled if the recipient is affected by an non-normal heat or cold, such as magic, breath weapons, and so on. The cancellation occurs regardless of the application (for example, a deny cold spell is negated by magical heat or fire as well as by magical cold). The recipient does not suffer the first 5 points of damage, after any saving throws permitted, from the heat or cold during the round in which the spell is broken. The spell ends instantly if resist fire or resist cold is cast on the recipient.
The material component for deny cold isa swatch of fur from a fur-bearing animal. The matenial component for deny fire is a small paper fan.
Notes: Rare spell.

Deplete Cinnabryl
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, $
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 item of cinnabry!
Saving Throw: None
This rare spell depletes cinnabryl. As much as one week's worth (one ounce) per three levels of the caster can be instantly depleted (four week's at 12th level, five week's at 13th to 15th level, etc.). The caster can choose to deplete a lesser amount of cinnabryl at the time of casting.
The spell is used infrequently because cinnabryl is better used than wasted. It is generally used to quickly turn raw cinnabryl into red steel, but can also be used as a form of attack against Inheritors, depleting their protective cinnabryl amulets.
The caster must touch the ttem to be depleted. If the item is worn by someone who does not want to be touched, the caster must make an attack roll against the target's normal Armor Class, with a —4 penalty to the attack roll (it is a called shot). The spell remains active for one round after casting; a caster not touching a target within that time must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or the deplete cinnabryl spell affects the caster's own cinnabryl.
If the amount of undepleted cinnabryl in the item is less than the amount the caster can affect, any leftover depletion applies instantaneously to the Time of Loss and Change. For example, ifa wizard depletes four week's worth of cinnabryl and the target is wearing only two week's worth, the target instantly suffers the effects of two weeks of the Time of Loss and Change. A depletion that places the target into the Time of Loss and Change is considered an evil act.
This spell does not speed the production of crimson essence, which depends on the amount of time spent near a person with a Legacy as well as time spent bathing in the magical radiance of the cinnabryl.
Notes: Common (and useful) only in the RED STEEL setting.

Depth Warning
(Divination)
Level: 2 4
Range: 0 or 40 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: 1 ship or boat; special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, a caster aboard a ship can alert the crew to a sudden change in water depth. This is particularly valuable if the change is the result of a reef, shoal, or underwater behemoth that may threaten the ship. The spell can detect any obstacle at least as large as the vessel's own keel.
When casting the spell, the wizard selects the depth that he wishes to monitor, up to 10 feet per experience level. The caster next decides whether to center the spell directly below the ship's bow, or 40 yards in front of the bow. (If the ship changes its heading, "in front" changes accordingly.)
The spell creates an intangible and invisible pole, which probes straight down to the desired depth, at the location chosen. Whenever it detects a large obstacle, a small voice magically alerts the caster, reporting the depth of the water in his ear. Only the caster can hear this voice, and while it rouses him from an ordinary slumber, it cannot negate the effects of magical slumber or unconsciousness, nor does it interrupt other spellcasting. Ordinary noise, even the sound of the sea, does not negate this small voice, nor do magical or natural deafness.
Once it begins, the magical voice continues to provide "readings" of the obstacle's depth in 10- foot increments. Each time the depth changes by 10 feet, the small voice records the change. If the depth increases to a level beyond that monitored by the spell, the small voice notes this fact, and then remains silent until the ship is again endangered. This spell does not provide physical protection against a collision with large objects, only notification that they exist. A large, live object (such a whale) can activate the spell, provided the object is larger than the protected ship. Any nonliving object capable of damaging the ship is also noted.
The material component of this spell is a clear glass bead, which is crushed in the process of casting.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Descent into Madness
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Mentalism)
Level: 7
Range: 10 yds-/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration; Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
More insidious and powerful than the feeblemind spell, descent into madness afflicts one creature with a random form of insanity. The spell can affect any creature with an Intelligence of low (5) or higher; however, an individual protected by a mind blank is immune to this spell. Creatures are entitled to a normal saving throw vs. spell to withstand the spell. The form of insanity caused by the spell is determined by aroll on the chart. The caster has no idea what kind of madness the spell inflicts on the victim, although he may be able to form an educated guess after observing the victim for a few rounds.

d%	Insanity Type
OI-15	Delirium
16-22	Disorientation
23-34	Phobia
35-40	Paranoia
41-44	Alienation
45-54	Amnesia
55-64	Hallucinatory insanity
65-69	Melancholia
70-74	Dementia praecox
75-83	Mania
84-89	Hebephrenia
90-95	Catatonia
96-00	Homicidal mania

The various types of insanity and their game effects are described in the boxed text. The descent into madness spell accelerates the process of insanity radically, producing an advanced condition almost immediately. For example, an individual rendered paranoid by this spell skips past suspicion and instantly regards his friends and allies as enemiesof the worst sort. The victim has a small chance to recover with the passage of time (as described under each type) but other than that the only ways to repair the effects of this spell are restoration, wish, or use of the psionic power psychic surgery.
The material component is a special cube of gold wire worth at least 500 gold pieces shapedto. represent a tesseract, or four-dimensional figure.
Notes: Uncommon (PO:SM).

Short Guide to Mental Effects
Alienation: The character experiences an acute sense of dislocation or wrongness in his surroundings. He is certain that he belongs somewhere else, although he cannot say where that might be. An alienated character regards everything in his surroundings—people, places, and things—as unnatural and threatening. As the condition progresses, the character loses his ability to function in society and gradually sinks into dementia praecox or catatonia over the course of 1d6 months.

Amnesia: The character purges his mind of anything that reminds him of the horrors he has experienced. Only his language skills remain; everything else—class skills, proficiencies, knowledge of people and places—vanishes. Hit points and saving throw values remain, but for all other purposes the character is now 1st level with no proficiencies. The amnesiac has a noncumulative 10% chance of recovery each month, During his amnesia, the character may actually begin his adventuring career again.

Catatonia: The catatonic completely withdraws from reality, ignoring all forms of external stimulus. He cannot move, speak, or act in any way, and may even ignore food placed in his mouth or painful injuries. There is only a 5% chance per month (noncumulative) that the catatonic will recover, although itis possible to provoke a catatonic into a temporary rage lasting 1d6 rounds by continuously annoying or pestering the individual.

Delirium: The character lapses into a state of delirium lasting for 3d4 days during which he wanders aimlessly and mumbles to himself or rants and raves. He does not recognize friends and is incapable of any rational action; he is easily frightened and flees most encounters. The character cannot cast spells. If restrained or threatened by combat, he becomes catatonic for 1-6 hours, After the delirium passes, the character returns to normal.

Dementia Praecox: This condition is similar to melancholia, but consists of a hopelessness or loss of volition. The character just can't bring himself to care about what is going on around him, even ignoring direct attacks or immediate threats to his life. Each time the character attempts an action, such as undertaking a journey, participating in a fight,or casting a spell, there is a 50% chance that his dementia overwhelms him and he does nothing. If the character loses his will to fight, he will not even defend himself, losing any Dexterity adjustments to AC and suffering other penalties as the DM deems appropriate. Dementia praccox persists until magically or psionically treated.

Disorientation: The character's surroundings make no sense to him, and he is temporarily unable to recognize places, people, or even his own possessions. The character retains command of his normal skills and abilities, although he fights with a —2 penalty to his attack rolls and has a 20% chance of miscasting spells. However, he has a difficult time initiating or following through on actions; if told to stay put, he may wander off, or if his comrades flee from a monster, he might remain behind, unaware of his danger. The character has a 5% chance per day, cumulative, of recovering from his state.

Hallucinatory Insanity: The character to perceives sights, sounds, or sensations from awful, alien dimensions that parallel our own. To other characters, the character appears to be hearing things, seeing things, or experiencing things that don't exist. These hallucinations have a very tangible reality for the character, and for any given action he undertakes—casting a spell, making an attack, even trying to walk across a room or study his spells—there is a 33% chance (2 in 6) that one of his hallucinations distracts him, preventing him from completing the action. Each month, there is a 10% chance that the character learns how to ignore these frightful apparitions and regains control of his perceptions.

Hebephrenia: A character suffering from hebephrenia withdraws from reality, wandering aimlessly, becoming child-like, and babbling or mumbling to himself constantly. This condition is completely debilitating. The character is effectively feebleminded, unable to participate in normal society or survive without constant care. The character may never recover from such a profound shock and has only a 5% chance (noncumulative) per month to recover.

Homicidal Mania: The character develops a persona that delights in mayhem and murder, and wants nothing more than to kill until it is sated. The character will stalk and kill victims (often those closest to the character), often employing bizarre or disgusting methods to further its enjoyment. Each month, there is a slight chance (5%) of recovery.

Mania: Terror of unimaginable depth turns the character intoa stark, raving madman. Every day, there is a 25% cumulative chance that he will suffer a manic episode lasting 1d6 hours, during which he attempts to attack or destroy anything around him. The maniac's Strength is incredible; a character's Strength increases by 6 points (count each percentile category of 18 as one point), to a maximum of 19. While the maniac is raging, he can easily turn on and kill people close to him, but he's just as likely to run off or try to gnaw the bark off a tree. Even if the character is in control of his senses, he cannot cast spells or embark on long or complicated tasks; the struggle to retain control consumes too much of his attention. The character has a 5% chance per month of recovering his stability.

Melancholia: A character afflicted with melancholia suffers endless fits of‘brooding and depression. Each day, there is a 5% cumulative chance that the character experiences an acute episode that completely disables him for 1d3 days. The melancholic will have no volition to travel,fight, cast spells, or even look after his own survival, although his friends may be able to lead him along on a journey or keep him out of the way on an adventure. Melancholia persists until magically or psionically treated.

Paranoia: The character becomes convinced that the agents of the Outer Powers are abroad in his world, his homeland, and even in his home town. They could be anywhere. At first, he is merely suspicious of strangers, but as the condition progresses, his suspicion spreads to those nearest him—his friends and family—and grows in strength, so that he begins taking precautions to guarantee his own safety. These precautions eventually include lethal attacks and plots against his former allies and friends. 
The condition only grows worse as time passes; without magical healing or psychic surgery, no recovery occurs. Generally, a paranoid PC becomes a NPC ut nder the DM's control after 1d6 months have passed, or whenever the DM feels that the player isn't role-playing his character effectively anymore.

Phobia: This leaves a lasting mark in the character's psyche and makes him mortally afraid of some condition or creature. A character confronted with the subject of his phobia automatically flees the scene with all possible speed for at least 1d3 full turns. If the character cannot escape the condition, he lapses into a catatonic state that lasts for 1d6 days.

Desert Fist
(Evocation)
(Province: Sand)
Level: 5
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 1rd.
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: None
An existing parcel of sand can rise up, forma fist, and pummel an enemy when this spell is cast. The fist (or tentacle) smashes against only one individual, chosen at the time of casting. The blow inflicts 4d4 points of damage. Any items worn or carried by the target must make a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow or be destroyed. If the fist is aimed specifically at an object (for example, a door, a barred window, or a cart), the target suffers a —4 penalty when making the save.
The fist's THAC0 is 4. It does not cause any heaving or shifting of the surrounding sand, so it can't form a barrier or throw a charging foe off his feet. It can leap up from the sand to attacka flying, jumping, or high-perched target up to 20 yards from the fist's point of eruption.
To cast this spell, the wizard clenches his fist around a handful of sand, then brandishes it while uttering the incantation.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Despair
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 2d4 creatures in a 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
When this spell is cast, 2d4 sapient creatures (Intelligence 3 or better) in the area of effect must make a saving throw ys. spell or lapse into a despondent depression as they realize the hopelessness and folly of their beliefs. Victims of despair are unable to attack, cast spells, move, or even engage in basic activities such as eating or drinking. Everything just seems pointless. The effects last for one round per level of the caster.
Creatures suffering from despair don't bother to defend themselves, so opponents can automatically strike, disarm, or bind them without resistance. However, when a creature is damaged or bound, it can attempt another saving throw vs. spell to shake free of the spell effects. Primes and Independents receive a +2 bonus to saving throws against this spell.
Mages of the Bleak Cabal developed this spell to share their point of view with their enemies.
Notes: Common for Bleak Cabal members; otherwise very rare.

Destroy Major Helm
(Alteration)
Level: 9
Range: 10 yds./level
Destroy Major Helm
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
(Alteration) 2 ¢
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 spelljamming helm
Saving Throw: Special
This very rare spell only affects a magical spelljamming power source within range of the caster. The source need not be operating, but the caster must see it and have aline of sight to the source itself, not merely the ship that houses it.
If cast on any sort of spelljamming helm (such as death helms, Lifejammers, pool helms, series helms, and furnaces), this spell utterly destroys the spelljamming magic and the physical helm seat. The being operating the helm suffers electrical damage equal in effects to a spark burst (1d3 points of damage, plus 1 per caster level; 144 points of damage in the phlogiston; each 10 points inflicts 1 point of hull damage). Further, the helmsman must make a saving throw vs. spell at a -2 penalty or be rendered unconscious for Id4 turns and unable to cast or regain spells for 1-3 days.
Any being within 30 feet of an operating helm on which this spell is cast must save vs. spell (without bonus or penalty) to avoid suffering 2d4 points of electrical damage. If the helm is not operating, the spell still destroys it, but the electrical discharge has only a 15-foot radius
While these effects apply to dwarven foundry power sources, those helms usually (85%) can be repaired, after 1d100 turns of constant work by skilled dwarves.
The spell's material component is a pinch of dust, which must have once been part of a permanent magical item.
Notes: Common for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise rare,

Destroy Minor Helm
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: 10 yds./level
Destroy Minor Helm
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 turn
(Alteration) = $
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 spelljamming helm
Saving Throw: Special
If cast on a minor helm, it utterly destroys the helm seat and the spelljamming magic. The helmsman operating the helm at the time suffers electrical damage equal in effects to a spark burst (143 points of damage, plus 1 per caster level; 1d4 points of damage in the phlogiston; each 10 points inflicts 1 point of hull damage). Further, the helmsman must make a saving throw vs. spell or be rendered unconscious for Id4 turns and unable to cast or regain spells for 1-3 days.
Lifejammers, pool helms, and series helms are utterly destroyed by this spell. Beings in those helms suffer the same damage as those using a minor helm, except that a lifejammer receives a beneficial discharge of energy: typically regaining 2-8 hit points at the same time as the unfortunate being is harmed by the helm's explosion.
The spell renders foundries and furnaces inoperative for 1d4+1 rounds.
The spell disables a major helm for 1-2 rounds (the helmsman must save vs. spell to avoid a 1d4 hit pomt loss and 1 round of unconsciousness; if successful, no damage is taken). If cast on a major helm or death helm, this spell reduces the target's Ship Rating (a measure of speed) by 1 point for 1d12 turns. Multiple castings cause overlapping and cumulative effects.
The spell's material component is a pinch of dust, which must have once been part of a magical item, or which has received a long-lasting dweomer.
Notes: Common for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise rare.

Destroy Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1d3 undead in a 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Special
This powerful variation of hold undead disintegrates corporeal undead creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than the caster's own. Undead that have 3 Hit Dice or less are automatically destroyed. Undead of 3+1 to 7 Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid destruction, but suffer 2410 points of damage even with a successful save. Undead of more than 7 Hit Dice are not destroyed outright, but instead suffer 5d10 points of damage, or 1410 points of damage if the saving throw is successful. Noncorporeal undead such as wraiths, spectres, and ghosts are not affected by this spell.
The spell requires a holy symbol once used by a priest of 8th level or higher.
Notes: Common for undead spellcasters; uncommon for necromancers; otherwise very rare. This spell can be learned only on the Demiplane of Dread.

Detect Charm — Red Wizard
(Divination)
(Mentalism)
Reversible
Level: 3
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1 creature/rd.
Saving Throw: None
This spell is like the 2nd-level priest spell of the same name; it can detect if a person or monster is under the influence of a charm spell or similar control such as hypnosis, suggestion, beguiling, possession, and so on.
The creature rolls a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster learns nothing. If the saving throw fails, the caster learns that the creature is influenced, and has a 5% chance per level to determine the exact type of influence. Up to 10 different creatures can be checked before the spell wanes. If the creature is under more than one such effect, only the information that the charms exist is gained. The type is impossible to determine due to conflicting emanations.
The material component for this spell is a heartflower, whose crushed petals are inhaled.
The reverse of the spell, undetectable charm, completely masks all charms ona single creature for 24 hours.
Notes: Common for the Red Wizards of Thay; uncommon for diviners and mentalists; otherwise rare.

Detect Disease
(Divination)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature or object
Saving Throw: None

The material component for this spell is a twig or small branch from any tree.
Notes: Restricted to diviners, necromancers, and witches; uncommon.

Detect Evil
(Divination)
Reversible
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10 x 180 ft. path
Saving Throw: None
This spell discovers emanations of evil (or of good in the case of the reverse spell) from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment is not revealed under most circumstances: Characters who are strongly aligned, do not stray from their faith, and who are at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if they are intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enables them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not. The degree of evil (faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) can be noted. Note that priests have a more powerful version of this spell.
The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide and 60 yards long in the direction in which the wizard is facing. The wizard must concentrate— stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura—for at least one round to receive a reading.
The reversed form of this spell is detect good.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Detect Illusion
(Divination)
(Mentalism)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 3 rds. + 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10 ft. x 10 ft./level path
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell the wizard is able to see an illusion and know it for exactly that. Others can be enabled to see illusions as unreal if the caster touches the creature with both hands while the creature looks at the illusion.
The material component is a piece of yellowtinted crystal, glass, or mica.
Notes: Common for illusionists; uncommon for mentalists and diviners; otherwise very rare.

Detect Invisibility
(Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10 ft. x 10 ft./level path
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard casts a detect invisibility spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addition, it enables the wizard to detect hidden or concealed creatures (for example, thieves in shadows, halflings in underbrush, and so on). It does not reveal the method of concealment or invisibility, except in the case of astral travelers (where the silver cord can be seen). It does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Detection is a path 10 feet wide along the wizard's line of sight to the range limit.
The material components of this spell are a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Detect Life
(Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 5 rds.
Area of Effect: 10 ft. x 10 ft/level path
Saving Throw: None
By use of this spell, the caster can determine if a creature is alive, including a creature in a coma or trance, or under the influence of a feign death spell. Any form of mental protection blocks this spell, as does any thickness of metal. An inch of stone or wood is treated as 10 feet of open space for the purpose of determining whether the spell functions.
The material components for this spell are a holy symbol and a hair from the head of a newborn animal.
Notes: Common for diviners; otherwise rare.

Detect Life — Alhoon
(Divination)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 3 rds.
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the alhoon to detect the presence of intelligent life within the spell area. The alhoon can tell if the life is aware (that is, whether or not it's awake, sane, and free of intoxication or sensory-debilitating magic or illness), but not precisely where or what the life is, or how many entities are present (if both alert awareness and slumber are detected, the alhoon can safely infer that at least two creatures are present, but that's all).
The spell does not allow direct mental contact, and will not detect magically or psionically shielded creatures or the wills of absent scryers such as wizards using wizard eyes or crystal balls. Beings hiding in an extra-dimensional space are considered not present. The spell can detect life that is invisible, concealed, disguised (even trapped within solid objects or magical forms), and extends into the Astral and Ethereal Planes, but does not reveal this state of the life, The spell gives no hint of the nature, thoughts, or inclination (e.g. hostile or friendly) of the life detected.
The spell ignores the alhoon's own energy, but detects beings in range that the alhoon knows are present (such as companions), so their presence may give a false warning of nearby life.
The alhoon can cast the spell to scan a smaller spherical area of effect (the sphere may have a radius of 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 feet instead of the maximum), but this size must be chosen during casting, and can't be altered thereafter—nor can the area of effect be changed in shape or location from a sphere centered on the alhoon. Solid or magical barriers do not affect the spell's detection. Undead can't be detected by means of this spell.
Notes: Restricted to alhoon (undead illithids), uncommon.

Detect Lycanthrope
(Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds.
Casting Time: 2
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
With the aid of detect lycanthrope, a caster can determine whether a creature is a lycanthrope or not (werewolf, werebear, and so on). The spell causes a lycanthropic target to glow and reveals the lycanthrope whether in animal, human, or humanoid form. The caster has a 5% chance per level to discern the exact type of lycanthrope and a 10% chance per level to learn the origin (natural, infected, cursed, etc.) and base stock of the lycanthrope (for example, human for a werewolf, wolf for a wolfwere).
The material component is a powder containing pinches of silver dust, wolfsbane, and belladona.
Notes: Restricted to divineis; uncommon.

Detect Lycanthrope — Gypsy
(Divination)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Casting Time: 3
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
With the aid of detect lycanthrope, a caster can determine whether a creature is a lycanthrope or not (werewolf, werebear, and so on). The spell causes a small glowing pentagram to appear on the palm of a human or humanoid, or on the brow of an animal, then fade. The caster learns the exact type of lycanthrope and its base stock (for example, human for a werewolf, wolf for a wolfwere).
The caster most often conceals the casting of this dweomer under another type of activity, such as palm-reading.
Notes: Restricted to spellcasters with gypsy blood; uncommon.

Detect Magic
(Divination)
(Universal)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10 x 60 ft. path
Saving Throw: None
When the detect magic spell is cast, the wizard detects magical radiations in a path 10 feet wide and up to 60 feet long, in the direction he is facing. The intensity of the magic can be determined (dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming), and the wizard has a 10% chance per level to recognize if a certain type of magic (alteration, conjuration, etc.) is present. The caster can turn, scanning a 60-degree arc per round. A stone wall of 1 foot or more thickness, solid metal of 1 inch thickness, or a yard or more of solid wood blocks the spell. Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may confuse or conceal weaker radiations. Note that this spell does not reveal the presence of good or evil, or reveal alignment. Otherplanar creatures are not necessarily magical.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Detect Metals and Minerals
(Divination)
(Province: Sand)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn + 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. x 5- or 20-ft./level path
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to divine the location of a single type of ore or mineral deposit per casting. The spell reveals the direction and distance to any such material within its area of effect, as well as the approximate amount of material present. The length of the path is 20 feet per caster level for common materials, 5 feet per level for precious metals or gems. Only one concentration of the material, if present, can be found each round that the spell is in force. (In general, larger concentrations will be noted first, and these may mask a smaller amount unless the caster spends extra time in his examination.)
The material components are a small magnet, a vial of weak acid, and a two-ounce lump of the desired material.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; very rare elsewhere.

Detect Phase
(Divination)
(Dimension)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 10 x 60 ft. path
Saving Throw: None
Creatures or objects that are phased—that is, in the Border Ethereal Plane—can be detected by using this spell. The spell affects a path 60 feet long and 10 feet wide; any phased creatures or objects in this area are revealed as soft, blueglowing outlines visible to anyone in the vicinity. Creatures or effects detected by this spell include phase spiders, ghosts in their ethereal state, characters or creatures employing oil of etherealness, psionic etherealness or phasing, and all other similar effects. Doorways or portals to extradimensional spaces are also detected, although anything hidden within remains unseen.
Detect phase does not reveal the location of creatures or objects concealed by magical invisibility or illusions. Note that detecting a phased monster doesn't necessarily give the caster the ability to attack it, but creatures such as phase spiders lose any special surprise bonuses they may receive if they are detected by using this spell.
Notes: Uncommon spell (PO:SM).

Detect Poison — Red Wizards
(Divination)
(Alchemy)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 object or 5- ft. cube

Notes: Common for alchemists, diviners, and Red Wizards of Thay; otherwise very rare.

Detect Psionics
(Divination)
(Mentalism)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 30-ft./level sphere
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to detect psionicactivity in the area of effect. Psionic activity is defined as the expenditure of psionic strength points (PSPs). The caster detects all psionic activity in the area of effect. (In other words, whether or not PSPs were spent in the round by any creatures or items within the area of effect.) How much other information he gains depends on his level, as follows:
* At Sth level or lower, the caster only determines whether or not someone or something within the area of effect is psionically active.
* At 6th to 8th level, the caster learns how powerful the activity is. Power levels of psionic activity are: low, 1 to 5 PSPs; moderate, 6 to 12 PSPs; high, 13 or more PSPs. (Note that at these levels the power detected includes all psionic activity within the area of effect and doesn't differentiate between individual psionic use.)
* At 9th to 12th level, the caster also learns where the activity is taking place (direction and distance), thus allowing him to identify individuals or objects expending PSPs in a given round.
* At 13th level or higher, the caster can differentiate the power-level expenditure of each individual in the area of effect.
Notes: Common on Athas (the DARK SUN setting); uncommon for diviners and mentalists; otherwise very rare. Known to be in Daltim's Tome of Fire.

Detect Scrying
(Divination)
(Mentalism)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt to observe him by means of clairvoyance, clairaudience, magic mirror, or similar spells. This also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magical scrying devices, provided the sensor is within the area of effect of the spell. Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to "sweep" areas for the duration of the spell.
When a scrying attempt is detected, the scrying entity must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the identity and general location of the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the seryer. Thus, the caster might learn, "The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs" or "You are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol."
The material components for this spell are a small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Detect Secret Passages and Portals
(Divination)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10 x 10 ft. area/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables a wizard to detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and similar devices. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been deliberately constructed so as to escape detection are detected by this spell—a trap door buried beneath crates ina cellar, an illusionary wall, or an amulet left in a cluttered room would not be detected.
The wizard affects an area of 10 feet square per level, so a 4th-level wizard could search four 10- foot by 10-foot sections of wall, floor, or ceiling. Any doorways or openings detected by this spell glow softly for one full turn. It's possible that a wizard might not find a secret compartment in the area of effect if the compartment is behind or under another object that covers it completely. This spell only detects the doorway or opening; the wizard may have to search for a mechanism or catch that opens the door.
Notes: Common for diviners; otherwise uncommon (PO:SM).

Detect Shapechanger
(Divination)
Level: 3
Range: 60 yd.
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rds./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature or 1 sq. yd./level
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wu jen is able to see the true form of any shapechanging creature (the true form is the shape most commonly assumed by the creature). If the creature is currently in that form, the spell reveals that it is a shapechanger but does not reveal the other forms possible to the shapechanger. The spell does not disclose the specific type of shapechanger nor the alignment or intentions of the creature. One creature or one square yard of area can be examined each round.
The material component for this spell is balm of honey and lotus flower smeared on the eyelids of the caster.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Detect Temporal Anomaly
(Chronomancy)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the chronomancer is attuned to turbulence in the timestream and can scan a 90-degree by 90-degree area (one eighth of a sphere) every round. After locating an anomaly, the severity can be determined by another round of concentration. The wizard has a 5% chance per level to recognize the cause, On the Demiplane of Time, distance is not a factor, and the spell detects the nearest turbulence in any scanned direction. On the Prime Material, the range is 30 yards per level. In either case, sight is also a limiting factor.
Notes: Restricted to chronomancers; common.

Detect the Living — Ninja
(Divination)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: S
Casting Time: 1 rd
Duration: 3 turns
Area of Effect: 60 ft. + 10 ft./level path
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the ninja to detect the presence of living beings. The spell works on living beings belonging to an animal species with halfa Hit Die or more. Thus the spell will not detect members of very small animal species or any plant species.
The spell's area of effect extends in a path 10 feet wide and 60 feet long (plus 10 feet longer per spellcasting level of the ninja) in the direction the caster is facing. Scanning a direction requires one round, and the caster must be motionless except for the somatic element of his spell (kuji-kiri finger exercises). When the spell is successful, the caster sees a glow in the direction of the lifeform; no one else can see the glow. The spell indicates direction only; it does not give specific location or distance.
This spell can detect living beings through walls and obstacles, but is blocked by 1 foot of solid stone, 1 yard of wood or loose earth, or a thin coating of metal. The spell does not indicate the type (species or level) of creature detected, only that such a being is present.
Ninja use this spell to detect someone hiding behind a paper room divider or a false wall. They can then attack through the wall to surprise their prey. Such attacks, when they are successful, are startling and sometimes deadly, but even when aided by a detect the living spell, a ninja striking in this way suffers a 4 penalty to his attack roll.
Notes: Restricted to ninja spellcasters and those trained by them; common.

Detect Thought — Phaerimm
(Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Maximum 1turn.
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the phaerimm to detect the presence and precise location of intelligent thoughts (that is, the mental activity of creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or greater, except those whose thoughts are shielded by psionic ability or spells). Solid barriers do not affect this detection, and its probing allows detection of all the separate sources of thought in a group of beings, and hints as to each thinker's general inclination (such as angry, bent on killing, sad, confused, searching for something, alert) and mental strength (that is, psionic powers or the ability to cast spells). Exact thoughts cannot be read by means of this spell.
If a psionic power is used, a spell cast, or a magical item activated by a being under surveillance by means of this spell, the "watching" caster learns the precise nature of the power or magic used, and any words of activation, spellcasting, or control.
This spell lasts up to 1 turn, unless ended earlier by the unleashing of any other spell by the caster. Phaerimm are immune to this spell; they radiate a confusing screen of mental chaos equal in effect to a mind blank spell,
Phaerimm use this spell to find beings masquerading as stone statues, part of their surroundings, and the like by means of magic—or to prevent ambushes when heading into an area known to contain enemies. The spell does detect the scrying of long-distance eavesdroppers using wizard eyes and the like, but not who or where these spying beings are.
This spell does not function within Myth Drannor, due to the inhibitions of the mythal.
Notes: Restricted to Phaerimm; common.

Detect Undead
(Divination, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 3 turns
Area of Effect: 60 ft. + 10 ft./level path
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to detect all undead creatures out to the limit of the spell. The area of effect extends in a path 10 feet wide and 60 feet long (plus 10 feet longer per level of the wizard), in the direction the caster is facing. Scanning a direction requires one round, and the caster must be motionless. While the spell indicates direction, it does not give specific location or distance. It detects undead through walls and obstacles but is blocked by 1 foot of solid stone, 1 yard of wood or loose earth, or a thin coating of metal. The spell does not indicate the type of undead detected, only that undead are present.
The material component for this spell is a bit of earth from a grave.
Notes: Common spell (PHB),

Detect Untruth — Savant
(Divination)
Reversible
Level: 1
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 3 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
A savant employing this spell is able to note an untruth spoken by a creature, including even a minor evasion of the truth.
The reverse of the spell, speak untruth, allows the savant to lie or evade the truth without being discovered by any spell of 4th level or less. The material component is the forked tongue of a snake.
Notes: Restricted to savants and sages. Generally intended for NPC use, though the DM might allow it for a non-savant of at least 9th level who has accumulated nonweapon proficiencies in subjects suitable for a sage (philosophy, reason, epistemology, and so on).

Detho's Delirium
(Enchantment/Charm, Necromancy)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
The caster of this spell touches a being who is drugged, drunken, unconscious, or sleeping. The caster then speaks the verbal component and rings a small silver or brass bell.
The subject receives a saving throw vs. spell at a2 penalty; if the save is failed, the being begins to speak. He speaks at random, in all languages known to him and on random, rambling topics. He cannot hear questions and cannot be forced by mental or magical control to give specific answers. While the person speaks, there is a 25% noncumulative chance per round that he reveals names (but not true names), passwords, words of activation, codes, directions, and other useful information. Note that the speaker rarely identifies such fragments of speech for what they truly are. Dreams, rumors, jokes, and fairy tales may be mumbled by the speaker, not merely factual information.
If the affected person is awakened at any time, the spell is broken.
Notes: Uncommon spell. Known to be in Detho's Libram.

Devastate — Old Empire
(Alteration)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes all ofthe caster's spells to strike with devastating effect. All targets suffer a -5 penalty to saving throws against the caster's spells, and all damage done by the caster's spells is increased by +2 per die (but the total damage cannot exceed the maximum possible rolled damage without the bonus; that is, a fireball spell can cause only the 60 points of damage possible from that spell's 10d6).
The spell must be focused through a solid gold pendant (value 100 gp), inscribed or cast with the sigil of the caster and worn around the caster's neck for the duration of the spell. If the pendant is removed or destroyed, the spell ends instantly.
Notes: Common, As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Diary
(Invocation, Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: 1 book
Saving Throw: None
This spell records all things said or heard by the caster, creating a running script of the caster's life and scribing it in a diary book prepared by the caster. In addition, the caster can choose to stand still and concentrate in order to record the image of any scene or person he studies, or to transcribe any mental notes he wishes to add to his journal. One round of concentration creates a simple sketch, but a full turn provides a highly detailed and accurate depiction of the scene.
The diary spell begins recording any unfilled page specified by the caster. Generally, typical adventuring and occasional conversation fills the book at about 10 to 20 pages per hour.
The diary book need not be open, but it must be within 5 feet of the caster—the spell ends if the book is removed from this distance. The spell ends if all blank pages have been filled; the caster knows the book is full.
The spell requires a book in which events can be recorded. The caster must hold the book as the spell is cast.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in Prismal's Pocket Library, Vol. I.

Dictation
(Invocation/Evocation)
(Geometry)
Level: 1
Range: 10-ft. radius
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes any words spoken by the wizard or anyone within 10 feet of him to appear on a pieceof paper or the blank page of a book. It is useful for recording conversations, verbal agreements, interrogations, or even notes or observations if the wizard doesn't want to take the time to write them down himself. Generally, a person reading aloud takes about one to five minutes to read a page, depending on how many words are on the page.
Foreign languages are not translated, although foreign words are given the correct alphabetic spelling in the wizard's native tongue; for example, the phrasec ‘est /a vie would appear as it does here, with no English translation, but a phrase or name in Arabic or Chinese would not be transcribed in those alphabets, Magical spells and invocations are not recorded, so this spell can't be used to create a backup copy of a scroll even as it's read by the wizard, but a clever wizard may be able to record a magical item's command word if an enemy within range uses it while the spell is in effect.
The material component for this spell is the blank page, scroll, or paper that the dictation will appear on. This must be prepared with a special wash of vinegar, which brings the cost to 10 gold pieces per page so readied.
Notes: Uncommon spell (PO:SM)

Dig
(Evocation)
(Earth)
Level: 4
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. cube/level
Duration: 1 rd./level
Saving Throw: Special
A dig spell enables the caster to excavate 125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per round (i.e., a cubic hole 5 feet on a side). In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start anew one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.
Any creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in, Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out ata rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.
The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth, When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.
To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and must continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items disappear at the conclusion of the spell.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Dilation I
(Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 4
Duration: As spell affected
Area of Effect: Next spell cast
Saving Throw: None
The dilation I allows a wizard to increase the area of effect of any one spell of levels 1-3. The area of effect is increased by 25%; thus, a stinking cloud would fill a 25-foot cube, while a slow spell would affect creatures in a 50-foot cube. Fractional measurements are dropped.
The dilation I spell must be cast immediately prior to the spell to be affected; ifa complete round or more elapses, the dilation spell is wasted. The dilation spell affects only spells that have areas of effect defined in feet or yards (numbers of creatures cannot be increased). The dilation affects only spells cast by the same wizard.
Notes: Uncommon (ToM).

Dilation II
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 5
Duration: As spell affected
Area of Effect: Next spell cast
Saving Throw: None
This spell functions exactly like the 4th-level dilation I spell, except that the area of effect of a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell is extended by 50%. Alternatively, the wizard can extend the area of effect of one 4th-or 5th-level spell by 25%. Fractional measurements are dropped.
The dilation II spell must be cast immediately prior to the spell to be affected; ifa complete round or more elapses, the dilation spell is wasted. The dilation spell affects only spells that have areas of effect defined in feet or yards (numbers of creatures cannot be increased). The dilation affects only spells cast by the same wizard.
Notes: Uncommon (70M).

Dimension Door
(Alteration)
(Dimension, Shadow)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of a dimension door spell, the wizard instantly transfers himself up to 30 yards distance per level of experience. This special form of teleportation allows for no error, and the wizard always arrives at exactly the spot desired— whether by simply visualizing the area (within spell transfer distance, of course) or by stating direction such as, "300 yards straight downward," or, "upward to the northwest, 45-degree angle, 420 yards" If the wizard arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, he remains trapped in the Astral Plane. If distances are stated and the spellcaster arrives with no support below his feet (i.e., in mid-air), falling and damage result unless further magical means are employed. All that the wizard wears or carries, subject to a maximum weight equal to 500 pounds of nonliving matter, or half that amount of living matter, is transferred with the spellcaster. Recovery from use of a dimension door spell requires one round.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Dimensional Blade
(Invocation/Evocation)
(Artifice, Dimension)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 weapon
Saving Throw: None
This spell makes a single weapon incredibly sharp by reducing one of its physical dimensions to an infinitesimal measurement. The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe.
Against creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent's AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 0, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 5. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM's discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments—muscle power doesn't help the blade at all.
The dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blade's length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It's dangerous to attempt to disarm the wielder of a dimensional blade; the disarming weapon must make an item saving throw vs, disintegration or be destroyed.
Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures. If the wielder has some way to detect ethereal creatures, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses.
The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone can wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass.
Notes: Uncommon (PO:SM).

Dire Charm
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Range: 120 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1d4 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, the caster ensorcels one person in such a fashion that the person truly enjoys killing and will immediately go berserk, attacking to kill friend and foe alike for the duration of the spell, unless a saving throw vs. spell is made. The definition of person is the same as for charm person, and the same restrictions apply, save that the charmed character has no qualms about slaying others.
The charmed individual will not attack the caster of this spell unless the caster attacks or harms the charmed individual first. If this happens, the charmed individual will attack only the caster.
If there is no one for the charmed individual to attack, he acts normally. As soon as someone other than the caster comes within sight (within the duration of the spell, of course), the dire charm takes hold and the charmed individual rushes to the attack.
The berserk attacks of the charmed individual do not grant any additional powers or abilities. If given a choice between two different ways to attack, the charmed individual always chooses the most deadly (he will cast a fireball spell before drawing his dagger, for instance). If the charmed individual is forced to attack something that is much more powerful, the DM might permit a second saving throw vs. spell to break the charm.
Notes: Rare spell. Known to be in Vaerendroon's Ineffable Enchantments.

Disable Helm
(Abjuration, Alteration)
Level: 6 ae
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 spelljamming helm
Saving Throw: Special
This spell temporarily scrambles an operating spelljamming helm within range. The selected target must be within the caster's lineof sight. If the target has no helm operating when the spell is cast, the spell is wasted. The affected helm instantly ceases operating and cannot be activated again by any means until the spell expires, There is no saving throw for the helm.
A saving throw is allowed for helmsmen. If successful, only 1d3 points of damage are suffered, accompanied by intense but brief head pains. If failed, 1d6 rounds of unconsciousness result with a loss of 1d3 hit points, plus 1 point per level of the caster.
The caster suffers a 1d4 hit point loss when casting this spell, as it is particularly taxing.
Notes: Uncommon for spellcasters from a spelljamming culture; otherwise very rare

Disarm
(Evocation)
(Mentalism)
Level: 1
Range: 100 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell summons minor telekinetic bursts that cause a person to drop any hand-held weapons or items. The bursts have enough force to move the items 1d20 feet away from the former wielder, forcing the person to spend a round retrieving his weapons or carried items. This spell affects only handheld items, not rings or belts or other items, unless these are physically carried in the hands (not worn).
Notes: Uncommon for mentalists and the Watch of Waterdeep; otherwise rare.

Discern
(Divination)
Level: 7
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 10 x 60 ft. path
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of a discern spell, who must be a wizard of at least Sth level, is given the ability to knowif another person has the potential to become a powerful wizard. Once cast, the discern spell is permanent (subject to a successful dispel magic spell). It functions continuously, as described later.
The discern spell is used to recruit members for various magical orders and schools of every alignment and ethic. The enspelled recruiter can learn if a person has the potential to become a powerful wizard simply by being within 10 feet of that person and interacting in a normal fashion with the candidate for two rounds.
The recruiter sees the potential for magic use in a candidate as a dim aura surrounding the subject. This aura does not really exist, so it is not detectable by other means, including true seeing. It is so dim that it cannot be perceived in bright light (such as direct sunlight). The aura is of constant strength, regardless of the potential of the candidate.
In short, a human, elf, or half-elf scanned by this spell registers favorably if the individual has an Intelligence of 15 or greater and scores of 6 or better in all other characteristics. A gnome registers favorably if the individual has the same and a Dexterity of at least 16.
Even if a positive result is obtained, the spell in no way guarantees that the person will become a great wizard (or even a wizard at all); it simply indicates potential based on intelligence, aptitude, and the will to achieve.
The Book of Black Circles stresses the fact that the spell is no more than a prediction; even a person who has the ability may opt not to become a wizard, quit before reaching a high level, or die before achieving greatness. The DM should use his judgment regarding who is highlighted by this spell's use.
The material component of the spell is a pinch of dust from a gem of seeing or eyes of minute seeing which have been powdered.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in the Book of Black Circles. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Discord — Elf
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Maximum 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell affects only individuals who are hostile to the spellcaster. Any such creature in the spell's area of effect must successfully save vs. spell or immediately attack its nearest friend or ally. The attacks continue for 1d4 rounds, after which the victims can attempt a saving throw each round to throw off the effect. Regardless of saving throws, the discord ends after a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.
The DM can further adjudicate this spell as desired: extremely strong ties of affection might allow a saving throw adjustment or result ina round of paralysis rather than attacks, while envy or rivalry might bloom into berserk rage.
The material component of this spell isa miniature apple of hammered gold.
Notes: Restricted to elves of chaotic alignment; rare.

Disfigure — Red Wizards
(Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
A victim of this terrible curse must save vs. spell to avoid being horribly transformed—covered in scars, boils, welts, warts, and other deformities, instantly reducing the Charisma ability score to 1. This renders the individual so repulsive that any viewer must save vs. spell or be unable to bear the individual's presence. Those failing the save may attack if normally inclined to be suspicious or hostile, while those normally inclined to be helpful or friendly might simply leave in disgust. Neutral creatures have a 50% chance to do either.
This spell is used as punishment, to insure the loyalty of retainers, or to punish rivals. The spell can be excised only by a remove curse, limited wish, or wish. A dispel magic spell has no effect.
Notes: Common for the Red Wizards of Thay; otherwise very rare.

Disguise
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell allows the recipient to assume the appearance of any person or creature of about the person's size (within 25%). A specific individual can be mimicked. The illusion allows the disguised person to appear to be wearing different garments, and alters his voice to sound like the creature or person being imitated (if the caster has heard the voice to be mimicked). It does not confer language ability; the disguised person must know a language in order to speak it correctly or understand it. The spell does not provide any abilities of the identity taken, nor personal habits, nor mental patterns: A person disguised as an aaracokra cannot actually fly.
The spell does not grant the abilities of another class: A wizard disguised as a fighter cannot wear armor, though he could appear to; likewise he could not wield a sword but could disguise his dagger to look like a sword.
The spell cannot be recognized as an illusion under normal circumstances. A detect illusion, true seeing, or similar magic will penetrate it, while a detect magic spell will reveal that the subject is somehow magical (and might reveal the school of magic). A disguised individual might make those around him suspicious if he acts in an unusual or atypical way, but mere disbelief in illusions will not penetrate this spell. The illusion lasts until dispelled or until the disguised individual is slain.
An unwilling recipient is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. At the DM's option this spell might affect some monstrous creatures as well an androsphinx could be made to look like a manticore, an minotaur could be made to look like an ogre, and so on.
The material component is a miniature mask carved of wood.
Notes: Common for Horned Society wizards in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK setting; otherwise rare.

Disguise — Hishna
(Alteration, Musion/Phantasm)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 day
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
This spell allows the caster to conceal his general appearance. It cannot be cast upon another. It conveys no language capability, and cannot dramatically alter the size of the individual. One disguise is created per casting. A caster who specifies a general individual of the same race and sex as himself will be unrecognizable by anyone he meets—he simply looks like someone they have never seen before.
If the caster attempts to create a specific individual's appearance, however, anyone he encounters who is acquainted with the individual receives a saving throw vs. spell to detect the difference. These saving throws receive +1 modifiers for each of the following:
* the disguise is a change of race
* the disguise is a change of sex
* the caster is engaged in conversation with the person making the saving throw.
The material component of the spell is the dried skin of a chameleon.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of hishna magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Disguise — Wu Jen
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
This spell allows the wu jen to assume the appearance of any creature of the same species or sub-species as himself, provided he is familiar with the person whose appearance he assumes. The spell creates a complete illusion of the assumed identity—face, body build, and even voice. The spell does not provide any of the abilities of the individual assumed, nor his personal habits or mental patterns. Those observing the disguised individual have a 5% chance per level of detecting the disguise, provided they are familiar with the person whose identity has been assumed. They notice a change in the behavior of the person, thus detecting the difference. Those who do not know the assumed individual or have only met him a few times automatically accept the disguise.
Actions entirely out-of-character allow all present to check to see if the disguise is penetrated. The disguised person radiates a faint aura of magic, noticeable to a detect magic spell. A detect illusion reveals the spell.
The material component for this spell is an item from the body of the assumed individual (hair, nail clippings) or an item that is constantly worn or carried by the assumed individual. This component must be carried by the wu jen at all times during the duration of the spell. Should it be set aside, the spell effect immediately ends. Important officials and powerful characters take great care in disposing of items that could be used to create the disguise dweomer—burning cut hair or fingernail parings, for example.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Disguise Bloodline
(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special
This potent illusion allows the spell recipient to hide the derivation, strength, and characteristics (both magical and physical) of another bloodline. For example, a scion of Anduiras could appear to have Brenna's or even Azrai's bloodline, thus foiling attempts to determine his actual bloodline. The transformation is undetectable unless a limited wish or a spell of comparable power is cast upon the recipient.
While under the effect of the spell, the recipient can use only blood abilities permitted by the illusory bloodline. The blood abilities must have the same effect when used by scions of both the actual and illusory bloodlines.
For example, a scion of Vorynn disguised as a scion of Brenna could use the alter appearance blood ability, which works the same for scions of both houses. The ability enhance sense could not be used, as it affects different sense for each bloodline. The blood ability functions at the same level of power as it normally does, regardless of the illusory bloodline's strength. Recipients of the disguise bloodline spell do not gain any blood abilities they do not normally have with their actual bloodlines.
If the spell's recipient tries to use a blood ability that is not allowed by the illusory bloodline, he must succeed in a saving throw vs. spell to use his natural blood ability. The die roll is subject to a modifier based on the illusory bloodline strength. If the roll fails, he cannot access his natural bloodline and blood abilities.

Illusory Bloodline	Modifier
* tainted		+2
* minor			0
* major			-2
* great			-4

This spell will not affect unblooded individuals. Sielshegh gems of both the actual and illusory bloodlines will not respond to a scion under the effects of this spell.
Unlike mask bloodline, this spell is powerful enough to affect the obvious marks borne by many ersheghlien and awnsheglien. If an awnshegh with the blood of Azrai were to cast this spell upon himself and disguise his bloodline as that of Brenna, he would look like an ershegh of that bloodline. His hideous or inhuman features would take on a natural beauty, and the DM would describe him in completely different terms.
Notes: Common in the BIRTHRIGHT setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Disguise Undead
(ilusion/Phantasm, Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect. 10 yds./level, 1 undead/level
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell the caster can alter the appearance of undead creatures so that they appear as they did in life. They appear to be healthy and normal (unless that's not how they were in life) and have no charnel odor or other telltale clue that they are actually dead.
The disguised undead creatures are still undead in all other ways and forms. They are revealed by the detect undead spell or similar divinations. Undead abilities that depend on the appearance of an undead being (a rotting visage that inspires fear, for example) do not function while the creature is disguised.
This spell does not allow undead beings to perform tasks beyond their normal limitations or allow them to speak if they lack that ability in their undead state. Disguised undead retain their alignment. Disguised undead can be turned if recognized as undead, and their disguised forms can be affected by all things in the normal fashion.
This spell combines illusion/phantasm and necromantic magic. It cannot be used by necromancers or illusionist specialists, unlike most spells of this nature. It is most often used by wizards to hide skeleton and zombie servitors in social situations.
The material component of this spell is the cocoon of the death's head moth.
Notes: Uncommon spell. Known to be in the tome Studies in Death, by the lich Kyristan.

Disintegrate
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature or 10 x 10 x 10 ft. cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes matter to vanish. It affects even matter (or energy) of a magical nature, such as Bigby's forceful hand, but not a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic shell. Disintegration is instantaneous, and its effect cannot be countered by any means short of a full wish Any single creature can be affected, even undead. Nonliving matter, up to a 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot cube, can be obliterated by the spell. The spell creates a thin, green ray that causes physical material touched to glow and vanish, leaving traces of fine dust. Creatures that successfully save vs. spell have avoided the ray (material items have resisted the magic) and are not affected. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected.
The material components are a lodestone and a pinch of dust.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Disintegrate Flesh — Witch
(Invocation)
Level: 9
Range: 50 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 40-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Neg.
All organic material in the area of effect is instantly disintegrated by this powerful spell. Living creatures and intelligent undead in the area of effect are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid disintegration. Dead organic material or slain creatures who have not risen as undead are destroyed automatically Leather, paper, wood, and other non-living organic materials are disintegrated as well, although magical items composed of these materials are entitled to an item saving throw vs. disintegration to resist destruction. Note that elementals and creatures of living or animated metal or stone are not affected by this spell.
The material component is a small tuning fork of cold-wrought iron.
Notes: Restricted to witches and evokers; rare.

Dismind
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Mentalism)
Reversible
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell separates an individual's mind from its body while cloaking the body in invulnerable armor of magical force. The body does not die; rather, it is placed in a state of suspended animation. It cannot be harmed by magic or by physical force, or even be moved. The body does not age, breathe, or eat and is not subject to disease, rot, infection, or poison, evenif these states existed in it before it was disminded.
The mind itself is cast loose invisibly across the Prime Material Plane, where it drifts serenely, undetectable by any means. Like the body, the mind cannot be harmed by any known process. It cannot control its movement or what it sees, and its memory is erratic. The DM should feel free to provide one to six small scenes, phrases, or situations for the disminded mind to witness in its flight, as seeds for future adventures. While in its disminded state, the mind cannot think, pray, study or research spells, or even choose to observe any particular person or locale.
Mind and body can be linked together by a limited wish or full wish.
The reverse of this spell, restore mind, also counters the effect; when cast on the body, the mind is immediately brought back. A saving throw applies to the restore mind and, if failed, body and mind are still separate. Mind and, body must be on the same plane in order for this spell to function.
Restore mind has a number of other functions as well: it can cure insanity (both magical and 1 otherwise), remove a feeblemind, and break all mental or magical controls, including geas, quest, and charms.
The dismind spell in its original form is often used by high level wizards in life-or-death situations to preserve themselves for future recovery and restoration.
Notes: Uncommon spell. Known to be in The Wizard's Workbook.

Dismissal
(Abjuration)
(Song)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
By means of this spell, a wizard on the Prime Material Plane seeks to force or enable a creature from another plane of existence to return to its proper plane. Magic resistance, if any, is checked if this spell is used to force a being home. If the resistance fails, the caster's level is compared to the creature's level or Hit Dice. If the wizard's level is higher, the difference is subtracted from the creature's die roll for its saving throw vs. spell. If the creature's level or Hit Dice is higher, the difference is added to the saving throw roll.
If the creature desires to be returned to its home plane, no saving throw is necessary (it chooses to fail the roll).
If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but the spell has a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.
The material component is any item that is distasteful to the subject creature.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Dispel Enchantment
(Abjuration)
Level: 8
Range: 0 or touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 8
Duration: 1 rd./level or 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius or item touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a more potent version of dispel magic. It can be cast in one of two way; first, it can create a persistent negation field that negates spells cast within the area of effect; second, it can temporarily neutralize magical items. The caster must choose which version is desired when the spell is cast. The dispel enchantment spell cannot affect dweomers that a dispel magic spell cannot affect.
A.) Spell Negation Field. In this use, dispel enchantment immediately and permanently dispels all spells within the area of effect that are in force at the moment of casting. The spell lingers for 1 round per caster level, possibly negating spells cast into or through the area, or operating on creatures entering the area. Each potion must save vs. spell as a 12th-level wizard or be destroyed. Spell effects receive a dispel check to see if they are negated. The base chance that a spell is negated is an 11 or higher on a d20, +1 per level of difference between the wizard using dispel enchantment and the spellcaster who created the effect that may be negated. For example, a 16th-level caster negates the fireball of a 9thlevel invoker ona roll of 4 or higher.
The negation field is immobile; it cannot be moved. Unlike a standard dispel magic spell, the caster's magic is only 50% likely to be dispelled by the field. The caster is free to leave the field and can dismiss it at will.
B.) Neutralize Item. The caster must touch the item to be affected. In a combat situation, this requires an attack roll if the object is worn or carried by an alert enemy. The item in question is rendered inert and useless for a period of 1 turn per level of caster, with no saving throw allowed. Potions, scrolls, and ointments or powders with a limited number of applications are destroyed by this spell. Only artifacts, relics, and weapons of +5 enchantment or better resist neutralization.
The material component is a token of special meteoric iron, worth at least 1,000 gp, which is expended in the casting of the spell.
Notes: Common for witches and abjurers; otherwise very rare.

Dispel Exhaustion
(Ilusion/Phantasm)
(Mentalism)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V,
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 2 turns/level
Areaof Effect: 1 to 4 persons in a 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: None
This spell utterly convinces up to four persons (as defined by the charm person spell) that they are well and rested. They can move and attack at double speed for 1 round every turn (as if hasted, but with no aging effect). In addition, the recipients temporarily recover 50% of any hit points that had been lost at the time the spell was cast. These bonus hit points are the first lost to any subsequent damage, and any remaining bonus hit points are lost at the end of the spell's duration (3 hours at 9th level). A second casting of this spell on the affected individuals while the first is in effect negates both spells.
Notes: Restricted to illusionists and mentalists; uncommon.

Dispel Fog
(Abjuration)
(Air, Water)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 10-ft./level radius
Saving Throw: Special
This spell eliminates normal and magical fog from the area of effect. Only fog and mist are affected, not bodies of water, rain, or other precipitation. The dispelled fog is gone permanently, but the empty volume may be filled in again with new fog if there is sufficient quantity in the area. However, the dispelled area stays clear for 1 turn per level of the caster level regardless of other conditions. The spell can be cast directly on a ship or boat; in this case the area free of fog will move with the vessel.
Creatures in fog or mist form (such as vampires) who are in the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. spell. A successful save indicates that the creature must transform to a form other than fog or mist; failure indicates that the creature takes 2d10 damage and must still change form.
Notes: Common for Sea mages; uncommon for Air and Water mages; otherwise rare.

Dispel Illusion
(Abjuration)
Level: 4
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, 8
Casting Time: 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 illusion or phantasm
Saving Throw: Special
Wielding this spell, an illusionist or wu jen can instantly dispel any illusion or phantasm cast by a wizard of another school. However, against a spell of mixed schools, their own schools, and nonwizard illusions, this spell acts as a dispel magic spell (11 or higher on 1420 to dispel, +1 per level difference). At the DM's option, this spell may affect items that create illusion and phantasmal effects as well.
Notes: Restricted to illusionists and wu jen; common for both.

Dispel Magic
(Abjuration)
(Universal)
Level: 3
Range: 120 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 30-ft. cube or 1 item
Saving Throw: None
When a wizard casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate magic it comes in contact with, as follows:
First, it removes spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).
Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1420 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1420 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1420 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds anda roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.
A dispel magic spell only affects a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, if it is cast directly upon that item alone. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect; if unattended, an item is automatically rendered nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.
Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option.
Note that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Dispel Mirage
(Abjuration)
Level: 3 
Range: 30 yds. + 1 yd./level
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 60 sq. ft./level, 10 ft. high
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a field that instantly destroys all natural illusions such as mirages. Magical illusions are destroyed, and invisibility is negated, with three key exceptions. Dispel mirage does not affect natural invisibility, illusions resulting from 6th-level spells and up, nor natural abilities that mimic such spells. Otherwise, this spell instantly banishes visual deceptions that overlap the area of effect, touch it, or occur wholly within it. If the magics or illusions are normally continuous or renewable, they recur one turn later.
Dispel mirage affects a base area of 60 square feet per level of the caster (for example, 10 feet wide by 6 feet deep) by 10 feet high. The actual area can take any shape the caster desires. For example, he could "fold" it in half to make it 20 feet high, covering 30 square feet at the base. Or he could fill a corridor 12 feet long by 5 feet wide, maintaining the 10-foot height. In open areas, the caster typically concentrates on a focal point, and the spell affects an area centered on that point.
The material component of this spell is a handful of sand, scattered into the air during casting.
The spell works in any type of terrain.
Notes: Common in arabian lands; otherwise very rare.

Dispel Silence
(Abjuration, Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 10-ft/level radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell negates the effect of magical silence within the area of effect for the duration of the spell. Following the casting of the dispel silence, all spellcasting, speaking, and actions can proceed normally.
For the duration of the spell, the area protected is proof against silence spells—they will not function within the area of effect. The dispel silence is immobile once cast, and cannot be cast on a creature or object.
The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered diamond worth at least 50 gp, flung into the air.
Notes: Rare spell in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Setting. Known to be in Bowgentle's Book.

Displace Self
(Alteration)
(Dimension)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
Emulating the natural ability of the displacer beast, this spell causes the caster to appear to be about two feet away from his true location. Any creature making a melee or missile attack against the caster automatically misses with its first attempt and suffers a —2 penalty on all subsequent attack rolls. In addition, the wizard also gains a +2 bonus on saving throws for any spell or special attack aimed directly at him, not at any other individuals or the area around him. The only spell that will reveal the caster's true location is true seeing.
The material component for this spell is a small strip of paper or leather twisted into a loop.
Notes: Common for dimensionists; otherwise uncommon (PO:SM).

Disrupt Dominion
(Necromancy)
Level: 8
Range: 20 yds.
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
By casting this spell, a caster tries to take control of undead creatures from another commanding entity. The entity in control of the undead must attempt a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, the disruption attempt fails. If unsuccessful, the caster has clouded the undead with assorted negative energy patterns that disrupt control. The undead do not automatically become the caster's minions, but the caster is free to exert his will on them and assume control in subsequent rounds.
Notes: Very rare; usually in the hands of a necromancer or lich. This spell can be researched only on the Demiplane of Dread.

Disrupt Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 70 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: Cone, 10-ft. dia., 20 ft. long
Saving Throw: None
When cast, the spell causes a cone of invisible, silent, mildly cold force to come into being, extending from the caster's outstretched hand. Any undead creatures within its confines or touched by any part of it are affected as follows:

* Skeletons, zombies, ghouls, shadows, and such undead with less than 4 Hit Dice are instantly blasted out of existence.
* Wights, ghasts, wraiths, mummies, spectres, vampires, ghosts, liches, and similar evil creatures from other planes that can be turned by priests, as well as other powerful undead not specifically named here, receive a saving throw vs. death magic to avoid destruction, and if successful instantly suffer 1d6 damage per caster level to a maximum of 10d6.
The material component to activate this magic is pinch of dust or a strand of cobweb.
Notes: Very rare spell. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Disruption
(Alteration, Necromancy)
Level: 9
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 40-ft. radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special
This powerful spell can utterly destroy undead and other magically animated creatures (even golems) in its area. Only three sorts of creatures are affected: undead, magically created or animated creatures, and creatures that magically control others. All others are unaffected.
Any ongoing spellcasting in the area of effect by these creatures is ruined. Effects of magical devices wielded by these creatures are negated for the round of disruption, but artifact powers are completely unaffected.
Creatures of these types with fewer than 6 Hit Dice are automatically destroyed. Creatures with 6 Hit Dice or more must save vs. spell to avoid destruction. Any creature that could be affected which escapes disruption is stunned (reeling and unable to act coherently) for 1d3-1 rounds.
If a controlling creature is disrupted, its magically controlled or charmed creatures are instantly freed.
Notes: Rare spell. Known to be in The Glandar's Grimoire.

Dissipate Vapor
(Abjuration)
(Alchemy)
Level: 3
Range: 10yds level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: 50-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Special
This spell disperses any gaseous substance, including natural or magical fogs, clouds, vapor, gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous or insubstantial form.
All gases, vapors, and gaseous breath weapons are dissipated in the area of effect at the instant of the casting and as they later enter the area; the spell creates a safe area within a large cloud of harmful gas.
Magical spell effects of Ist through 3rd level that create gases and vapors are immediatedly negated, while spells of higher level suffer the effects of a dispel magic spell at the caster's level.
A gaseous creature receives a saving throw vs. spell; failure inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (to a maximum of 10d6). Success means the creature takes half damage and is forced from the area.
The material component is a bit of charcoal.
Notes: Uncommon for abjurers and alchemists; otherwise rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Distance Distortion
(Alteration)
(Earth, Dimension)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 5
Duration: 2 turns/level
Area of Effect: 10-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell can be cast only in an area completely surrounded or enclosed by earth, rock, sand, or similar materials. The wizard must also cast a conjure elemental spell to summon an earth elemental. The elemental serves without attempting to break free when the spellcaster announces that his intent is to cast a distance distortion spell The spell places the earth elemental in the area of effect, and the elemental then causes the area's dimensions to be either doubled or halved for those traveling over it (spellcaster's choice). Thus, a 10-foot x 100-foot corridor could seem to be either 5 feet wide and 50 feet long or 20 feet wide and 200 feet long. When the spell duration has elapsed, the elemental returns to its own plane.
The true nature of an area affected by distance distortion is undetectable to any creature traveling along it, but the area dimly radiates magic, and a true seeing spell can reveal that an earth elemental is spread within the area.
The material needed for this spell is a small lump of soft clay.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Distant Diary
(Invocation, Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: 1 book
Saving Throw: None
A more powerful version of the diary spell, this spell is similar in most regards (see below). The principal differences are these:
* The diary book records regardless of the caster's distance, although the caster must be on the same plane.
* If the wizard re-casts the spell before a previous casting ends, the diary continues without pause; the diary book need not be nearby to continue the spell.
* If the wizard prepares a series of volumes before casting the spell, the spell will go to the next volume as each volume fills, without ending the spell.
Thus, a wizard could prepare several large journals and leave them in the safety of his tower, dictating to them constantly as long as he casts each distant diary spell before the previous one lapses completely.
The diary records all things said or heard by the caster. The wizard can transcribe mental notes and record scenes or portraits by concentration on them; one round for a simple sketch. Typical adventuring and light conversation fills the book at about 10 to 20 pages per hour. The magical properties of a text cannot be copied by this spell, though the caster can summarize the material in his own words.
Notes: Very rare. Known to be in Prismals Pocket Library, Vol. IV.

Distort
(Alteration)
(Song)
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 sound source within 5 ft.
Saving Throw: None
The caster can alter the nature of any sound, provided its source is within 5 feet. Although the volume of the sound remains the same, its resonance, timbre, pitch, or tone can be changed. For example, the sound can be given a buzzing quality, an echo effect, or an underwater tonation, and its pitch can be raised or lowered. By mental command the caster sets the type and amount of distortion, which remains constant until he actively changes it again. Any distortion that the caster can mentally hear can be imposed on the sound. This spell may, at the DM's option, adjust the saving throw of a sound-based attack.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Darssons Notes.

Distort Life I
(Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hour
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell alters one aspect of an unborn creature according to the wizard's will. Only external features can be changed with this spell. Its operation is very uncertain; the base chance of success depends on the aspect and the manner in which the wizard wants to affect it. Some changes require two or more generations to manifest themselves fully (these are abbreviated to "G;" for example, G3 is the 3rd generation). Each generation might produce defects. The DM should arbitrate success chances as required. Typical chances include:
* Coloring: base or spots, stripes, ete —80%
* Covering: hide (GO), fur (G2), scales (G6), feathers (G9).—40% The number of generations to go from one to another is the difference in rating (scales to feathers takes three generations).
* Toughening: Two generations required per AC shift, to about 5 above base. —20%, plus current AC x 5% (e.g., AC 5 to AC 4 is 45%). Nonmagical resistance to fire, cold, acid, etc. can be bred, but not invulnerability.
* Limb Endings: These affect either a pair of limbs, or a ti enlarged claws, spiked tail, manipulative digits —40%
* Limbs, Whole: Add or modify a pair of limbs or a tail, minimum two generations: wings, prehensile tail, increase speed (by 1 MV).—30%
* Senses: More acute hearing, vision, smell, touch, or taste—S0%
Infravision or ultravision can be increased 30 feet per generation to 120 feet maximum.
* Mouth: Teeth size, hollow incisors, these take two generations 40%
* Noise (larynx): Alters pitch, volume, etc.—70%.

Failure means an aspect might change in a way other than that intended, a different aspect may change, nothing may happen, the chance of defects may arise, or a combination of these possibilities may occur (see table). In these cases if there is a successful alteration in an early generation and a failure in the subsequent generation, the partially altered strain is still useful as advanced breeding stock since it carries one generation's worth of change. However, a partial alteration will tend to disappear entirely in three generations.

d%	Distortion I Failure
01-30	Right aspect, wrong way
31-70	Nothing happens
71-80	Wrong aspect affected
81-90	Raise defect chance 10%
91-00	Roll twice, ignoring rolls above 90.

The material component is a silver model of the creature in question (worth 200 gp x the creature's Hit Dice) which must be hammered flat during the casting.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from IMAGINE Magazine.)

Distort Life II
(Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2 hours
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell resembles distort life I, but can be used to alter internal and fundamental aspects of the offspring. Its operation is very uncertain; the base chance of success depends on the aspect and the manner in which the wizard wants to affect it. Some changes require two or more generations to manifest themselves fully (these are abbreviated to "G;" for example, G3 is the 3rd generation). Each generation might produce defects. The DM should arbitrate success chances as required. Typical chances include:
* Lungs: Breathing or tolerance of different gases, add or remove gills; three generations.—50%
+ Glands: Produce venom, acid, fire, or remove these; two generations.—30%
* Eating Habits: Carnivore, omnivore, herbivore; two generations per step. 50% Unusual eating habits (wood, iron, etc.); five generations.—40%
* Size: Per 5% increase or decrease in size. Each 10% shift changes the creature's hit points by 1. For example, a 3 Hit Die creature bred to +20% size would have 3d8+2, (between 5 and 26 hp). At +4, the creature's base HD increases by 1. Decreases work similarly.—50%
* Age of Maturity: Per 10%, up to 10% per generation possible, up to 50%.—base 60%

d%	Distortion II Failure
01-15	Right aspect, wrong way
16-50	Nothing happens
51-75	Wrong aspect affected
76-90	Raise defect chance 10%
91-00	Roll twice, ignoring rolls above 90.

Failure means an aspect can change in a way other than that intended, a different aspect can change, nothing can happen, the chance of defects can arise, or a combination of these possibilities can occur (see table). In these cases if there is a successful alteration in an early generation and a failure in the subsequent generation, the partially altered strain is still useful as advanced breeding stock since it carries one generation's worth of change. However, a partial alteration will tend to disappear entirely in three generations.
A small gold model of the creature (worth 600 gp x the creature's Hit Dice) is hammered flat during the casting.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from IMAGINE Magazine.)

Distort Life III
(Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 3 hrs.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell alters one aspect of an unborn creature according to the wizard's will. This spell can bestow special and magical powers. The chance of inducing defects is 20% or higher if this spell is used. Its operation is very uncertain; the base chance of success depends on the aspect and the manner in which the wizard wants to affect it. Some changes require two or more generations to manifest themselves fully (these are abbreviated to "G;" for example, G3 is the 3rd generation). Each generation can produce defects. The DM should arbitrate success chances as required. Multiple generation requirements are secretly rolled by the DM: e.g. ‘Gd3' is 1 to 3 generations. If the wizard confers innate spell abilities or magic resistance, then the offspring will be a magical (enchanted) monster, and subject to any special bonus or penalties that affect this type of creature. Typical alterations include:
* Intelligence: Per point of intelligence, creature average can be raised once per generation.—30% minus the current Intelligence as a %
* Speech (minimum 5 Intelligence and larynx required): Base Gd4.—40%
* Shape Changing: Base Gd3+1.— 50%
* Touch Attack (paralyze, petrification, Strength drain): Base Gd3—40%
* Gaze Attack (petrification): Base Gd4.—30%
* Minor Breath Weapon (1 hp/HD): Base Gd3.—40%
* Major Breath Weapon (1 die/HD): Base G3d3.—30%
* Vision (detect invisibility): Base Gd3.—60%
* Vision (into other planes): Base Gd3.—50%
* Invisibility: At will; Gd4.—30%
* Regeneration: 1 point per round; Gd4.—30%, minus 10% per point over 1.
* +1 or Better Weapons to Hit: Base Gd4.—20%

d%	Distortion II Failure
01-10 	Right aspect, wrong way
11-60 	Nothing happens
61-70 	Wrong aspect affected
71-90 	Raise defect chance 10%
91-00 	Roll twice, ignoring rolls above 90.

Failure means an aspect can change in a way other than that intended, a different aspect can change, nothing can happen, the chance of defects can arise, or a combination of these possibilities may occur (see table). In these cases if there is a successful alteration in an early generation and a failure in the subsequent generation, the partially altered strain is still useful as advanced breeding stock since it carries one generation's worth of change. However, a partial alteration will tend to disappear entirely in three generations.
A small platinum model of the creature (worth 1,200 gp x the creature's Hit Dice) is hammered flat during the casting.
Notes: Very rare. (Updated from IMAGINE Magazine.)

Defect in breeding

These tables are used for changes in magical breeding stock due to straight crossbreeding or use of the distort life spells. The DM decides if crossbreeding combinations will create viable offspring.

Base change of defect;	20%

Siblings used		+40%
Cousins used		+20%
distort II used		+10%
distort III used	+20%

Upon reaching mature age, there is also a chance of a new defect occuring.

Base chance of defect at maturity	10%
 Age spell, per 10% of mature age	+5%

Distraction
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: 40-ft. cube, 1 person/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell causes one or more persons in the area of effect become too preoccupied to notice any movement, sound, or smell around them. Individuals resistant to sleep and charm are likewise resistant to this spell.
Other individuals receive a saving throw vs. spell to remain unaffected. If only two or three individuals are to be affected, they each save at a -1 penalty, while if only a single individual is to be affected the saving throw is at a -2 penalty. If the action that the distraction is intended to conceal is expressly forbidden, and attempted in plain sight (for example, passing through a guarded door), the penalties are negated and a saving throw bonus of +2 is received instead.
The spell can set up a surprise attack if used carefully. A physical blow or contact, even jostling, negates the spell immediately.
The material component is a piece of black gauze.
Notes: Rare spell; most commonly used by mage/thieves. (Updated from IMAGINE Magazine.)

Divination Enhancement
(Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 2 turns + 2 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows a wizard to extend both the duration and range of the wizard eye spell and any divination spells of Ist to 4th level. Duration and range are both increased by 50% for the length of the divination enhancement. All divination spells cast within the duration of the enhancement are increased. The expiration of the enhancement ends all divination spells in effect.
Notes: Common for diviners; otherwise uncommon (ToM).

Divining Rod
(Divination, Enchantment)
(Artifice)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 60 yds.
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to enchant the branch of a ginkgo or fruit tree to locate a common item that is hidden from view. Unlike locate object, the caster does not need to have a specific mental image of a particular item; rather, he only needs to state the name of the general type of item he wishes to locate, such as buried treasure, edible plants, or fresh water. However, divining rod will not locate invisible or magical items, nor will it locate items protected by obscure item or a similar spell.
Once the branch is enchanted, the caster holds the branch with both hands. If the desired item is within 60 yards, the enchanted branch points in the direction of the item and gently pulls the caster along. The spell is not blocked by lead or any other substance. However, if an impenetrable obstacle is reached, such as the ground or a wall, the branch presses against it and stops. If there is no item matching the description within 60 yards, the branch does not react, although the caster can move about and continue to search.
The material component for this spell is the branch from a ginkgo tree or a fruit tree, such as peach, apple, or lemon. The branch must be shaped like the letter Y, so that the caster can grasp a fork of the branch in each hand.
Notes: Uncommon for diviners and artificers; otherwise rare (PO:SM).

Dolent's Helm
(Abjuration, Evocation)
(Mentalism)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 3 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes a transparent helm of psionic energy to come into being about the recipient's head. The helm allows a saving throw vs. spell against all psionic attacks, as well as any psionic devotions or sciences that allow mental influence or control. Dolent's helm provides no protection against spells.
The spell fails if the recipient is wearing any head covering when the spell is cast; also, the spell does not work while any head covering is worn. If the protected creature would be allowed a saving throw against a psionic ability for any other reason, the creature can use the most advantageous defense.
Notes: Very rare spell. (Updated from POLYHEDRON Newszine.)

Dolor
(Evocation)
Level: 5
Range: 2 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 2 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the wizard attempts to force compliance or obedience from some oppositely aligned or hostile creature from a plane foreign to that of the spelicaster.
When uttering the incantation (see The Casting), the wizard can be mentally assailed by the creature if it has a higher Intelligence than the caster. In this case, the creature has a 5% chance per point of superior Intelligence of effectively charming and dominating the wizard. In the case of such control, the creature will then do with the spellcaster as its alignment dictates,
If the spellcaster is distracted or interrupted during the casting of the spell, the subject creature is able to effect the charm and domination if it makes a successful Intelligence check.
The dweomer causes unease in the creature in question during its mere reading (the round of casting), making all of its saving throws against commands, charms, and nonoffensive spells at a penalty of -1, the adjustment favoring compliance.
On the round thereafter, the subject becomes nervous and filled with doubts, causing the penalty to go to—2.
On the last round of effect the creature actually feels a dull, all-encompassing dolor, which brings a penalty of -3.
Thereafter, the creature is no longer affected by the dolor spell and it makes further saving throws without adjustment.
The Casting: The verbal component of the spell deals with the class of creature in question, containing as much information as possible about the subject creature (common name, true name, history, previous dealings, and so on). The spell is long and complex; its incantation must be read aloud from a book or scroll specially prepared for this purpose. If the creature's true name is used in the incantation, the creature's magic resistance, if any, is negated for the duration of the spell.
Notes: Very rare spell.

Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Mentalism)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 5
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.
The domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any person until the spell is ended by the subject's Intelligence (see the charm person spell) Elves and half-elves resist this enchantment as they do charm-type spells. When the spell is cast, the subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell at a penalty of —2, but Wisdom adjustments apply. Failure means the wizard has establisheda telepathic link with the subject's mind. Ifa common language is shared, the wizard can generally force the subject to perform as the wizard desires, within the limits of the subject's body structure and Strength. Note that the caster does not receive direct sensory input from the subject.
Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously selfdestructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, there is no limit to the range at which it can be exercised, as long as the caster and subject are on the same plane.
Aprotection from evil spell can prevent the caster from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it cannot prevent the establishment of domination.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Doom Legion
(Necromancy)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7 rds.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 120-yd. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates skeletons or zombies from the remains of an army defeated in battle. The spell must be cast on the site of the conflict, where the fallen bodies still lie. When cast, only the bodies or skeletons of the losing side will be animated.
If the battle took place less than three months before the casting of the spell, the undead will be zombies. Any longer period of time will yield skeletons—even if the bones have turned to dust, they reassemble when this spell is cast.
The number animated depends upon the radius of the spell and the number of bodies within it. The DM decides what level of conflict was fought on the grounds where the spell is cast, then rolls dice to find how many undead are raised (see table).
Animated bodies that are less than 3 feet beneath the surface will dig themselves out within 1 turn of the casting of the spell. Those deeper will not animate. The bodies cannot have been disturbed before the casting of the spell. Those that have been moved, A searched, or in any way disturbed the same day as the spell is cast do not animate.
The animated army of undead might ignore the spellcaster and undertake their original mission, depending on how long the vanquished army has laid at rest.

Level of Battle	Number of Undead
Skirmish 	3d12
Small Battle 	6d12
Major Battle 	10d20

Time at Rest	Chance to Ignore
1 day		90%
1 week		80%
1 month		70%
3 months	60%
1 year		50%
5 years		40%
10 years	30%
50 years	20%
100 years	10%
Over 100 years	0%

An army of undead that ignores the spellcaster will not necessarily attack him, but it will not obey him, It will pursue revenge for its defeat, advancing on its previous enemy, even if that no longer makes sense, considering the passage of time. Should the army not ignore him, the undead will consider the spellcaster its new leader and will follow him until every individual is somehow destroyed.
The material components for this spell are a drop of blood from one of the unit's old opponents (or a descendent thereof) plus a handful of soil from the unit's original homeland.
Notes: Common on Athas (the DARK SUN setting); otherwise very rare.

Door of Death — Dragon
(Necromancy)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V
Casting Time: 2 rds.
Duration: Affects 50 Hit Dice or levels
Area of Effect: 1 doorway/portal
Saving Throw: Neg.
Using this spell, the draconic caster can ward a particular doorway or portal so that any creature who tries to pass through the portal without first speaking a word of command is immediately the subject of a modified form of the death spell. (Here the word "portal" can also refer to a cave opening or tunnel no more than 30 feet in diameter.) A single application of this spell can kill up to 50 Hit Dice or levels of creatures before becoming inert.
Each creature passing through the portal rolls a saving throw vs. wand with a -2 penalty; a successful save means that the creature survives. Even if the creature successfully saves, the creature's Hit Dice or level is deducted from the total power remaining to the warded doorway. Ifa creature passing through the door has more Hit Dice or levels than remain in the spell, the spell ends and the creature is unharmed.
Example: A dragon has cast door of death on the entrance into her cave. Three characters try to pass through the portal—a 15th-level fighter, a 16th-level cleric, and a 16th-level wizard. The fighter and cleric fail their saving throws and die immediately; the wizard makes his saving throw and survives. The door of death spell as expended 47 levels (15 + 16 + 16), which means that only 3 remain. Later, a 4th-level thief walks through the door. Since the thief has more levels than remain to the spell, the spell ends and the thief is unaffected.
Note that only the doorway or portal itself is warded. An individual could conceivably smash through or otherwise penetrate the wall next to the door and enter safely. A portal protected by a door of death spell radiates a strong aura of necromantic magic. While casting the spell, the dragon can choose whether or not the warding is to be visible. If the dragon chooses visibility, the portal is outlined by a faint blue glow; this glow isn't bright enough to be seen in full daylight, but it is obvious under twilight or darker conditions.
According to rumor, a number of human wizards have developed their own (9th-level) versions of this spell. All have suffered highly unpleasant fates when they tried to use the spells. Almost half died during the casting, while the others suffered various degrees of permanent paralysis or contracted terminal illnesses.
Notes: Restricted to dragon spellcasters; uncommon. Known to be in the Draconomicon.

Double Dweomer
(Alteration)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: The next spell cast
Saving Throw: None
The double dweomer spell allows the caster to affect two targets with an individually targeted spell instead of one. The affected spell must be a spell of 6th level or less that can target a single creature or object. The affected spell must be cast in the round immediately after the double dweomer spell is cast, or the double dweomer spell is wasted.
The targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The details of the affected spell do not otherwise change (range, Hit Dice affected, etc.). Thus, a double dweomer spell allows a caster to affect two creatures with a disintegrate spell, a stoneskin spell, or Melf's acid arrow. It has no effect over spells such as Bigby's interposing hand, wall of ice, sleep, fireball, or other spells that either do not directly affect a creature or have more than one target. A touch-delivered attack spell can be modified, but the caster must be able to touch both targets simultaneously.
The material component is a thin glass rod, 3 to 4 inches long, which the wizard snaps in half when casting the spell.
Notes: Very rare spell.

Double Steel
(Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell allows the caster to create a duplicate of any bladed weapon she has touched—or seen in use—out of thin air. The duplicate weapon matches the original exactly-even to any magical powers it has or enchantments laid upon it. When the spell expires, the blade fades away and cannot be recalled (that particular weapon cannot be duplicated by that wizard again), Until the spell expires, the caster or another being can wield the blade, and upon touching it is made instantly aware of all of its powers.
This duplicate weapon vanishes instantly if wielded by a caster who attempts to cast any spell, but the caster is free to work magic if the blade is wielded by someone else. Anyone who wields the duplicate does so as if proficient with it.
When the caster is fighting all alone, she can choose to wield the weapon either with her own THAC0 or with that of a particular being she has seen employing the original weapon. The spell does not reveal to the caster what that THAC0 is; this can be only guessed at, given the blade's performance in the being's hands. The caster's choice cannot changed once made.
The duplicate weapon created by this spell has tangible physical existence while the spell lasts. It can be used as a prop or tool. It can even be seized by a foe of the caster and used against her, though she has the ability to make the duplicate blade vanish at any time by willing it out of existence.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their apprentices, and select Harpers; rare.

Double Undead
(Necromancy)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Components: V, SM
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 undead
Saving Throw: None
This rare dweomer replaces one skeleton or zombie with two identical undead. The spell affects one animated zombie or skeletal creature of 3 Hit Dice or less (but not specially created undead such as crawling claws, ju-ju zombies, or baneguard). The spell must be cast within three rounds of the undead creature's animation. It remains is dormant until triggered.
When triggered, this spell replaces the protected skeleton or zombie with two creatures identical to the original, but with maximum hit points. Any magical item carried by the protected undead is randomly teleported and is not duplicated. The duplicates are immune to turning. Any spells affecting the original do not carry over to the duplicates, however, the caster controls the duplicates. Duplicates vanish when destroyed with all of their equipment. They vanish after 2 hours per level of the caster if not destroyed before then.
The double undead spell effect operates only if triggered. Two triggers are common; one must be chosen during casting.
* Spell Trigger: If any spell or spell-like ability affects an undead protected by the double undead spell, the dweomer is triggered.
* Turning Trigger: If the protected undead is affected by an priest's (or equivalent's) ability to turn undead, the dweomer is triggered.

A separate double undead spell is required for each undead to be protected. Multiple double undead spells won't work on the same undead.
The material component of this spell is a small crystal prism and two hairs from any source.
Notes: Restricted to necromancers; rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Dragon Breath
(Evocation)
(Alchemy)
Level: 7
Range: Varies
Components:
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 3 rds.
Area of Effect: Varies
Saving Throw: Special
This actually represents a whole family of spells, as a different spell exists for each type of dragon. Each must be found or researched separately. Further each requires the tooth of its type of dragon, at least adult age, before the spell can be researched or cast.
The spell enables the wizard to unleash a breath weapon up to three times as if the wizard was a dragon of the same sort as once possessed the tooth (once per round, with no actions other than movement allowed). The wizard must have the proper incantation for the type of dragon chosen; different wordings exist for the different dragon types, the most widely known being white, black, green, and blue. Red and copper are hard to find, and the incantations for other dragon types are very rare indeed.
The precise effects of each breath weapon—range, area of effect, and saving throw details—are as given in the MONSTROUS MANUAL description of dragons. The "age" of the dragon is determined by the wizard's experience level (see table). For example, a 14th-level wizard (the lowest level at which this spell can be cast) spitting acid as a black dragon inflicts 8d4+4 damage, as if he were a juvenile dragon (age category 4).

Caster Level	Dragon Age
14 		4
15-17		3
18-20		6
21-23		7
24*		8

The material component of this powerful spell is the tooth of a dragon. Any type of dragon can be the source—even teeth taken from a dragon's skeletal remains or undead form will work.
Notes: Rare for alchemists, otherwise very rare. Within these parameters, white and black are common, green and blue are uncommon, red and copper are rare, and others are very rare. (Updated from DRAGON Magazine.)

Dragon Fall — Dragon Knight
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 100 yds.
Components: V
Casting Time: 3
Duration. 500 ft. of fall/level
Area of Effect: 1 dragon, 1 age/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to feather fall, but it designed to be cast on dragons with the intention of saving a dragon injured in flight from plummeting to the ground. The spell enables the caster to affect one age class of dragon for every level of the caster. For instance, a 7th-level dragon knight wizard can cast this spell on any dragon up to mature adult in age. As with other dragon knight spells, dragon fall does not work on other creatures or objects.
Notes: Restricted to Dragon Knights of Krynn (in the DRAGONLANCE setting) and those trained by them; common.

Dragon Message — Dragon Knight
(Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: 30-ft. +10-ft. level
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to the message spell, but enables one dragon knight to communicate with a dragon or another dragon knight. The knight can include up to one of these per level of spellcasting ability. The message travels in a straight line of sight and is heard by all those included within a diameter of 30 feet plus 10 feet per level. The knight need not whisper; regardless of the tone or the volume of the wind, the message is clearly heard by the recipients. As long as there is a clear line of sight, the knight need not point to the recipient.
Notes: Restricted to Dragon Knights of Krynn (in the DRAGONLANCE setting) and those trained by them; common.

Dragon Scales
(Abjuration)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes the body of the recipient to become completely covered with dragon scales, effectively raising the subject's Armor Class by 2 for the duration of the spell; this modification is in addition to the subject's normal Armor Class (for instance, if the subject's AC is 6, dragon scales raises it to 4). Dragon scales also temporarily reduces the subject's Charisma by 2 points.
The color of the dragon scales is the same as that of the scale used as the spell's material component; however, the color has no other effect on the spell.
The material component of a spell is a scale from any dragon.
Notes: Rare spell.

Dragon Tongues — Dragon Knight
(Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Components: V,M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell bestows the same general language abilities as the 3rd-level tongues spell, but gives only knowledge of the languages spoken by dragons.
Notes: Restricted to Dragon Knights of Krynn (in the DRAGONLANCE setting) and those trained by them; common.

Dragonrage — Elf
(Elven High Magic)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 10
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell does not outwardly change the caster's appearance, but temporarily grants the caster the powers of a dragon of randomly determined type. When this spell is cast, roll 1d6 and refer to the following table to determine type. Then roll 1d8 to determine age.

Die Roll	Type
1-2		Copper
3		Brass
4		Bronze
5		Silver
6		Gold

Die Roll	Age
1		Juvenile
2		Young Adult
3		Adult
4		Mature Adult
5		Old
6		Very Old
7		Venerable
8		Wyrm

Once cast, the wizard gains the abilities of thechosen dragon type and age. These abilities are
Hit Die modifier (to each of the wizard's HitDice), combat modifier, fear radius, save modifier, Armor Class, attacks (including breath weapon), movement (including flight), and special attacks and defenses.
The additional hit points are the first ones lost by the wizard. Once they are gone, the wizard lose his own hit points normally.
While dragonrage is in effect, the caster also gains many of the personality traits of the appropriate dragon. A wizard becoming a brass dragon, for example, will be arrogant and egotistical while the spell is in effect, while a bronze dragon wizard will be inquisitive, humorous, and interested in warfare.
The material components of this spell are any type of dragon scale and a candle.
Notes: Restricted to elves able to cast elven High Magic; uncommon. Used for the defense of the elven homeland (for example, Evermeet Island).

Dragonshape
(Alteration)
Level: 9
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 9
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster or another being to take the form of a type of dragon the caster has personally seen. A specific individual dragon cannot be mimicked, including avatars of dragon deities. The spell can be cast on any person of 15th or higher level. Unless the person shares one alignment (ethos or moral) with the dragon form selected, the spell fails.
The person acquires all the powers of that type of dragon, including (but not limited to) innate spell-like abilities, immunities, magic resistance, breath weapon, fear aura, senses, movement, Armor Class, THAC0, and all physical abilities. Any age category up to adult can be chosen by the caster. An individual affected by the spell retains his own intelligence, but cannot cast any of his own memorized spells while in dragon form (though dragon spell abilities may become available). The person's own racial or magical abilities do not function in dragon form.
All items that are worn or carried will temporarily become part of the dragon form; they cannot be used and have no effect while the person is in dragon form. Items that have been set aside can be worn or used by the dragon, so long as they can be used by the dragon (that is, manipulated with altered speech, claws, and so on— further, the item must either change size or be easily adapted to the dragon form).
The number of Hit Dice the dragon form has depends on the age and type of dragon. The change to dragon form requires a roll for hit points unique to the particular casting, which is not adjusted for Constitution or other factors. A character slain in dragon form remains a (dead) dragon. Parts taken from a slain dragonshaped individual spoil any magical operation they are used for.
Changing back to normal form can be done by the recipient at will and takes only a second; this ends the spell. Otherwise, the spell lasts one turn per caster level. The recipient's remaining hit points after the change will be proportional to the dragon form's remaining hit points (round fractions up). The individual must make a successful system shock check immediately after the change or be incapacitated for a full day.
Each time after the first that the spell is cast within any 10-day period, a system shock check to avoid death is required for the caster. Also, the recipient likewise checks upon each change, from human to dragon and from dragon to human, if the change to dragon form is made more than once in any 10-day period.
At the DM's option, mastering a dragon power sufficiently to use it in combat may require 1d3 rounds, if the recipient is unused to the shape of the particular dragon. Except for purely physical abilities such as flying, biting, and breathing, unmastered powers, including draconic combat maneuvers, can't be used effectively. Furthermore, to equal the skill of a true dragon in the use of draconic powers requires more practice than the duration of the spell will easily provide.
The material component is an incisor tooth from a great wyrm of the dragon type whose shape the recipient will assume. If available for sale at all, these might be had for 2,000 gp to 20,000 gp each, depending on the type and rarity of the dragon.
Notes: Very rare spell.

Draincone — Phaerimm
(Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: 30 yds.
Components: V
Casting Time: 7
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Cone, 10 ft. long, to 4-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell is an improved version of dweomer vortex, in which the drained spell energy does benefit the caster. The spell creates a shimmering conical field in midair, its small end towards the caster, and its circular open end of 4-foot-radius size. The draincone moves in response to the wielder's thought, floating freely through the air at a rate per round up to 6, so long as it does not strike solid barriers (which it doesn't affect, but can't pass through). If it encounters magical areas of effect, and waiting but not yet-triggered magical traps), it whirls, flashes, and "drinks" them.
Draincones cannot affect antimagic shells, or any prismatic spell of Sth level or higher. They have no effect on astral silver cords. They destroy, and are destroyed by, globes of invulnerability and lesser magical barriers upon contact.
A draincone is not ended or affected by its wizard casting other spells, or wielding magical items; it ignores all magic caused by its caster. A dispel magic spell collapses it while it absorbs the dispel magic spell.
A draincone can drain up to 12 spell levels: It can destroy twelve Ist-level spells, or any combination of spells up to a total of 12 spell levels, before vanishing in a harmless, spectacular whirl of winking lights. A spell that exceeds the limits of the cone is destroyed as it collapses.
When a draincone collapses, its caster receives all of the spell levels it has absorbed, to a maximum of 12, as energy that must be immediately used to "boost" a single existing memorized spell. The spell is augmented so that it will do damage, and take effect, as if cast by a wizard of 12 (or however many spell levels were drained) levels higher than the caster. If the caster has no spells memorized, or none that can be augmented in this way, the energy fades, and its benefit is lost.
Notes: Restricted to Phaerimm; common.

Draindoom — Phaerimm
(Alteration)
Level: 9
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Until caster's death
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This deadly variant of the lifedrain spell "leapfrogs" out of control, recasting itself at random intervals, draining nearby magic to do so (which is why some areas of both the Anauroch desert and the Myth Drannor ruins are "magica 271 XAq Dramatic Death, Malraz's rc dead," drinking the magical energy of magical items brought into them).
The spell destroys liquid water (not ice) outside the bodies of living things, in a succession of 70- foot-radius spheres. The first sphere is centered on the caster, and the spell will cast itself again 2d12 times, at random locations within 1 mile of the original casting site. No one can control where these later castings will occur, or when: the second always occurs 1d4 days after the first, the third 1d12, the fourth 220, and all subsequent spontaneous castings are d100 days after the previous one.
These spontaneous castings require no caster or material components. They always drain any magical items within their area of effect (saving throws vs. "disintegrate" apply, to avoid this draining) when forming.
Water cannot fall into, form within, condense within, or flow into the spherical area of spell effect. Living creatures find conditions in the area uncomfortably dry; for each turn spent there doing anything more than resting, a creature loses 1 hit point due to dehydration. Plants can't grow in a draindoom field and desert-like conditions soon occur.
A draindoom can't be affected by dispel magic or by water magics: only a limited wish spell cast on either the original casting site, or the site of the most recent spontaneous recasting will halt it. A properly worded wish spell can also end the spell. Otherwise, its effects last and continue until the moment of the caster's death.
Casting a draindoom permanently drains 1d12 + 1d4 hit points from the caster, If this drain kills the caster, the draindoom takes effect only at two sites: the place of casting and one "jump." The effects last for one year from the moment of the caster's death.
The material components of this spell are a piece of bone anda fire of any sort and size. The bone is placed in the flames during casting, and both are consumed ina flash by the spell. The spell's area of effect is centered on the caster.

Drawmij's Instant Summons
(Conjuration/Summoning)
(Dimension)
Level: 7
Range: Infinite + special
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 small object
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to his hand. The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving.
To prepare this spell, the wizard must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp value in his hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. At some point in the future, he must crush the gem and utter the final word. The desired item is then transported instantly into the spellcaster's right or left hand, as he desires.
The item must have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell. During the initial incantation, the gem becomes magically inscribed with the name of the item to be summoned. The inscription is invisible and unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast the summons.
If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, and the caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the PLANESCAPE Campaign Setting boxed set). Note that special wards or barriers, or factors that block the teleport or plane shift spells, can also block the operation of this spell. Objects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell.
If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply. Furthermore, the details of the location of the item are more specific, and the item is more easily traceable with other types of scrying magic.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Drawmij's Light Step
(Alteration)
(Song)
Level: 1
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell gives a creature a very limited form of levitation. The creature walks normally over any surface, but walks so lightly that no tracks are left behind. If the creature breaks into a charge or run the spell ends immediately.
The creature can also move acrossa fluid as well as a solid surface, but the movement rate is reduced to one-half the creature's normal walking rate, as the creature must step carefully. The light step spell will not enable a creature to walk across turbulent water or ocean waves, however, since the chaotic motion of the fluid disturbs the levitation field. The spell actually makes the creature unable to activate pit traps. It doesn't allow the creature to leap higher or jump safely from a cliff, only to walk with a lighter step. This spell will also increase the movement rate of the creature by 50% for the duration of the spell.
The material components are a bit of fur taken from a cat's paw and a duck's feather.
Notes: Uncommon spell.

Drawmij's Marvelous Shield
(Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3
Duration: 1 turn/level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This spell is an improved version of the Istlevel shield spell. The marvelous shield will protect the caster against attacks from all sides, including the rear and above, provided the wizard is aware of the attack. A surprise attack will completely dispel the protection of the marvelous shield. The protection afforded by the spell is an increase of 2 against all attacks, so the improved shield acts as AC 0 against hand-hurled missiles, AC 1against device propelled missiles, and an Armor Class of 2 against all other attack forms.
Notes: Uncommon spell (0G).

Drawmij's Merciful Metamorphosis
(Alteration)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: Permanent
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
Drawmij developed this spell as a merciful way to get rid of an adversary. The spell polymorphs an opponent into another creature as does the polymorph other spell, but the target's saving throw vs. polymorph is made at a2 penalty. The target can be polymorphed only into a natural animal no larger than a typical herd beast. The polymorphed creature does not need to make a system shock roll to survive the spell. The polymorphed creature immediately assumes the mental state of the animal, forgetting all knowledge of its previous self. The animal does not radiate magic or the creature's original alignment aura, so there is little evidence the animal was anything other than what it appears to be now.
If returned to its original form by a dispel magic, limited wish, or wish, the creature will be quite bewildered, suffering the effect of a 4thlevel confusion spell for 2d4 rounds. After theconfusion passes, the creature gradually recovers its previous knowledge and memories over a period of 1d4 days.
The material component is a cocoon soaked in a balm of honey, powdered yellow-white moss agate worth 500 gp, and powdered emerald worth 700 gp, all of which vanish with the casting of the spell.

Dread Whisper
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4 A
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The creature, if failing a saving throw vs. spell, will be unable to talk to, look at, or even think about the wizard for the duration of the spell. Upon mention of the wizard, the creature will be wracked with unimaginable terrors and assailed by all manner of horrid visions regarding his death.
This spell is most often used to keep someone from speaking of the wizard's presence, such as if. the wizard were spotted entering a place he had no business being. It can also be used to keep someone from revealing secrets about the wizard and is very good at causing individuals to leave the wizard alone.
Notes: Common in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Dream
(Invocation, Mlusion/Phantasm)
Reversible
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
The dream spell enables the caster, or a messenger touched by the caster, to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the spell, the caster must name the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no doubt as to his identity.
As the caster completes the spell, the person sending the spell falls into a deep trancelike sleep, and instantaneously projects his mind to the recipient. The sender then enters the recipient's dream and delivers the message unless the recipient is magically protected. If the recipient is awake, the message sender can choose to remain in the trancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed during this time, the spell is immediately cancelled and the sender comes out of the trance. The whereabouts and current activities of the recipient cannot be learned through this spell.
The sender is unaware of his own surroundings or the activities around him while he is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, both physically and mentally (i.e., he always fails any saving throw) while in the trance.
Once the recipient's dreams are entered, the sender can deliver a message of any length, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way; the recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the sender gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the sender's mind returns instantly to his body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the sender to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.
The reverse of this spell, nightmare, enables the caster to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the recipient, who is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and unable to regain spells for the next day. A dispel evil spellcast upon the recipient stuns the caster of the nightmare for one turn per level of the cleric countering this evil sending.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Dream Globe
(Divination)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 24 hrs.
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell traps the subject inside a sphere of magical energy. The wizard utters the final word of the incantation, then reaches out and touches the target creature; a successful attack roll is required if used in combat. A successful saving throw vs. spell negates the spell. If the spell is used during combat, the saving throw has a +2 bonus, unless the subject is immobilized or magically held. A sleeping subject has a saving throw penalty of -4,
If the saving throw is failed, then the subject is caught in a sphere of force that resembles the effects of sepia snake sigil. The subject remains floating in the sphere in a dreamlike state until the spell ends.
The wizard can try to pry information from the trapped creature once per hour, and such questioning requires all the wizard's concentration. For each question the wizard asks, the subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to resist the delvings of the wizard. The DM may assign penalties or bonuses to the roll based on the character's willingness to divulge such information. Certain spells and magical items, such as mind blank or an amulet of proof against detection and location, make an encapsulated creature immune to interrogation.
The spell can be recast on a creature already englobed to continue the effects beyond the 24- hour period. This allows the subject an unmodified saving throw vs. spell.
The subject can be released in two ways. The spell ends when 24 hours have elapsed. In this case the subject is groggy and incoherent for 1d4+1 rounds. The second way is to shatter the globe itself. If struck by any hard object, the globe shatters if it fails an item saving throw vs. crushing blow. The sudden collapse of the globe renders the subject unconscious for 4d4+4 turns.
The material components for this spell are a crystal sphere (crushed during the final phase of the casting) and a piece of amber.
Notes: Uncommon for diviners and Dream mages; otherwise very rare.

Dream Vision
(Invocation)
Reversible
Level: 4
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 turn
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wu jen is able to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the casting, the wu jen names whom the message is for. The caster must know the identity of the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no question as to whom is intended. For example, the wu jen could send a dream to the governor of Changtai Province, even if he has never met the man, since there is only one governor of that province. However, he could not send a dream to the sake-maker of a village in that province, since there might be several sakemakers in that village.
Upon completing the physical casting of the spell, which requires but a turn, the wu jen falls into a deep, trance-like sleep. At this point his spirit leaves his body and travels instantaneously to the subject. Thereupon, the wu jen is able to enter the dreams of the subject and deliver his message unless the subject is magically protected from spirits. If the subject is awake when the spell is cast, the wu jen can choose to return to his trance-like sleep until the recipient goes to sleep or he can cancel the spell. The wu jen does not learn anything about the current activities or whereabouts of the subject, only whether he is asleep or awake.
Once the wu jen enters the dreams of the subject, he can deliver a message of any length desired, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon awakening. The communication is one way—the subject cannot offer information or ask questions of the wu jen. Neither can the wu jen gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the wu jen's spirit returns instantly to his body. If the body is disturbed in any way while using this spell, the wu jen's spirit becomes lost. The body remains in its comatose state until some means is found to rejoin the wu jen's spirit with his body, such as a restore spell.
The duration of this spell is the amount of time required for the wu jen to enter into the dreams of the other and then deliver the message. Thus, the duration could be as short as one round or as long as several hours.
The reverse of this spell, nightmare vision, allows the wu jen to send a hideous and unsettling vision to his victim. The identity of the vi tim must be known as stated above and the victim must be asleep. This nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes the victim to lose 1d10 hit points. Since the victim has not rested, he is fatigued as if he had not had the night's sleep and is unable to regain spells. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects of the nightmare.
The material component for this spell is a bowl of incense.
Notes: Common in oriental settings; otherwise very rare.

Drenal's Amok Needles
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Artifice)
Level: 3
Range: 100 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 5 rds.
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the caster throws one or more large needles into the air and points at the desired target. The needles then dart toward the target and start poking the victim. The needles inflict 1-2 points of damage each per round. If the creature moves, the needles move with it, but they will not pass out of the range of the spell. If the range is exceeded, the needles fall directly to the ground, and the spell is ended. Any magical protection, such as shield or armor (or protection ‘from evil if the caster is evil) requires each needle make an attack roll to hit the target, as if the caster were attacking.
The caster can enchant one needle for every three levels, with a maximum of four needles. Once the spell is cast the caster no longer needs to concentrate on the spell.
The needles must be 5 inches long and made of a light metal alloy (requiring substantial effort to make—25 gp each). They must be stored in a container of magical liquid. The liquid used to cover the needles costs another 25 gp to manufacture and must be replaced each month. The needies can be re-used if they are recovered.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Drenal's Notes.

Drenal's Annoying Poke
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 turn + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.
To cast this spell the caster must chant the verbal component and poke the victim with a 3- to 4- inch sewing needle. This attack does one point of damage. From that point on, whenever the creature sees the caster make a thrusting motion, it feels as if it has been poked again.
This is at first annoying. Each time the thrust is made by the caster, the victim takes one hit point of damage. If zero hit points is reached, the victim faints and awakens in 1d4 rounds.
After three pokes, a creature of Intelligence 10 or less must make a successful saving throw vs. spells or be driven to panic (50%) or rage (50%). Panic causes the victim to run in the path of least resistance for one round. Rage causes the subject to try to assault the caster at any cost short of fighting to the death.
The material component for this spell is a long sewing needle.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Drenal's Notes.

(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds.

Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell distracts the subject from what it is doing, by focusing its attention on the caster. The creature to be distracted must be able to clearly see the caster. A creature with more than 6 Hit Dice is immune to the spell.
A target creature that fails a saving throw vs. spell momentarily stops paying attention to its surroundings until the end of the round after the spell is cast. In that round, the creature loses initiative, all attacks, Dexterity and shield bonuses to Armor Class, and cannot perform spellcasting or any other activity that requires the creature to think. Hence, the creature could swallow if liquid were poured into its mouth, but could not itself grab and imbibe a potion.
The component for this spell is a stick with a brightly colored piece of cloth attached to the top. This is thrust from side to side in the air while the verbal component is spoken.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Drenal's Notebook.

The needle used in this spell cannot be tainted in the solution used in the casting of Drenal''s amok needles
The flagrant and malignant use of this spell could be an evil act, with consequences. Drenal used this spell only as a last resort.

Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a transparent barrier through which no sound can pass. When this wall is placed so as to block an entire portal, passage, or hole, no sound can pass from one side to the other. The sound barrier must be anchored to four surfaces. The desired effect is possible only when the entire passage is covered, and sounds will not easily travel through the surrounding walls. The barrier can be horizontal or vertical. The casting of this spell involves sticking small soft clay mounds that have feathers stuck in them, in two corners of the area to be blocked (such as the corners where a door meets the floor), to form a base for the barrier.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Drenal's Notebook.

Drenal's Stone Flame
(Enchantment/Charm)
(Alchemy)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 1 rd. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: 1 open flame
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast upon an open flame no larger than that of a torch or very small campfire, the flame is turned into an orange stone, holding the size and shape of the flame at the time of casting. The stone flame remains attached to the torch or ground as if it were a part of it. The stone gives off illumination asif it were flame, but no heat. It will return to flame at the end of the duration. If the stone is shattered, the flame is extinguished.
The material component for this spell is a mix of fine sand and sugar, which is sprinkled in the air as the caster chants the verbal component and points at the desired open flame.
Notes: Very rare spell. Known to be in Drenal's Notebook.

Drought — Hishna
(Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 100 yard square/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell requires a full hour of concentration on the part of the caster, and must be performed in the center of the area to be affected. Upon completion of the casting, the area begins to dry out—if it was swamp or marsh, the water drains away; if it was field or forest, the ground withers to dust, and all vegetation perishes within a few days. Drought cast on an area with more than a foot of standing water will have no effect—the water drains away, but other water flows in to take its place. The magical drought lasts until natural or magical changes in the weather bring on rain. A dispel magic spell is effective only if completed successfully before the casting time of the drought spell has elapsed.
The material component of the spell is the dried foot of a desert rat.
Notes: Restricted to practitioners of hishna magic (the Maztica setting); common.

Drowsy Insects
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Range: 6 yds.
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 5-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell summons a small cloud of stinging and biting insects anywhere desired within the spell range. These insects swarm around all those in the area of effect, unless the victims are protected by fire, cold, or smoke.
Although the stings and bites cause no damage and are hardly felt, all those swarmed must make a saving throw vs. poison. If the save is successful, the spell has no effect on that creature. If the saving throw is failed, the creature instantly falls into a light slumber and remains asleep for 2d6 rounds unless awakened.
The victim wakes up when shaken, struck, or otherwise disturbed. Loud noises such as fighting have a 50% chance of awakening the individual. Actions such as shouting in his ear certainly will.
The material component for this spell is a live honeybee or stinging insect.
Notes: Common in oriental lands; otherwise very rare.

Due North
(Divination)
(Geometry)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 5 rds./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
This divination provides the caster with an unerring ability to determine which way is true north. The spell indicates polar north as opposed to magnetic north, should they differ, and operates in any environment or setting. If the caster happens to be in the southern hemisphere, the spell instead indicates true south—the caster can sense which pole is indicated.
Notes: Uncommon for diviners or geometers; otherwise very rare. Known to be in Prismal's Pocket Library, Vol. 1.

Duhlark's Animerge
(Alteration)
Reversible
Level: 6
Range: 5 yds./level
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 2 creatures
Saving Throw: None
A highly specialized form of polymorph other, this spell allows the caster to fuse two creatures together into one unique, amalgamated form, allowing a number of traits from each creature to remain dominant in its new singular form. This spell will not work on any animals that have special magical adaptations such as plane shifting powers or fire breath. If the spell is used on such creatures, both animals must save vs. death magic or perish due to the spell conflicting with their innate magics.
The altered creature acquires the following basic traits from one or the other of the animals involved in the merge: Body shape, size, movement modes, speed, diet, intelligence, attack modes, defense modes, special attacks, special defenses, and Armor Class. If the caster is a transmuter (specialist wizard of alteration magics), the caster can request which traits are adopted in the new form; if not, the creature created is randomly determined by the DM.
When the spell is cast, both animals must be within twenty feet of each other. The final animerged creature will emerge in the former location of the larger animal. Both animals must make system shock rolls to survive the transformation (60% chance); if one fails, the spell fails and the other must save vs. death magic to survive. Ifa caster attempts to merge opposingblooded creatures (warmblooded birds and mammals vs. coldblooded reptiles and insects), the survival chance drops to 40%. Should either creature have an Intelligence greater than semiintelligent (2-4), there is a 75% chance that the creature's mind will shatter, creating an uncontrollable mad animal. The creature will use every physical ability it has to escape and attack anything that moves, perceiving movement as something causing it pain. The creatures are 99% unlikely to breed true unless the magic has been sealed with a permanency spell.
Special Notes: Evil NPCs have used this spell to creature the Broken Ones (see the MONSTROUS MANUAL Tome)
The reverse, Dulark's separation, reverses Dulark's animerge. It will not function on offspring of a magical merging that has bred true. The component animals must survive the same system shock as when originally merged those that survive are apparently normal in every way.
Notes: Restricted to Dulark and his apprentices; very rare.

Duhlark's Glasstrike
(Alteration)
Reversible
Level: 6
Range: 40 yds. + 2 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6
Duration: 1 hr./level
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius globe
Saving Throw: Neg.
When cast, the glasstrike alters all living and nonliving material to glass for the duration of the spell, making the target quite vulnerable to shattering and breaking. Curiously, this spell doesn't affect magical items; an individual could be turned to glass but still be wearing functional plate mail +2 and a ring of the ram. Living beings under the effects of the spell are unaware anything has happened and are effectively in stasis during the spell's duration; if the caster is a transmuter (and particularly cruel), he can allow living recipients of the spell to remain conscious and aware of their fragile fate. Any material turned to glass can be affected by such spells as glassteel or permanency. The spell can be canceled by a reverse casting of the spell or by dispel magic.
The reverse of the spell is called Duhlark's glassremove. Its only function is to negate a previously-cast glasstrike spell.
Notes: Restricted to Dulark and his apprentices; very rare.

Duhlark's Glasstrike Trap
(Alteration)
Reversible
Level: 6
Range: 40 yds. +2 yds/level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 day/level
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius globe
Saving Throw: Neg.
This is an alternative form of Dulark's glassstrike that is cast on a glass surface. The spell remains viable but unactivated, for up to 24 hours per caster level. If an object or creature comes into contact with (or within 2 feet of) the enspelled surface in accord with a condition set by the caster, the glassstrike spell takes effect as normal.
The caster chooses the parameters of the spell trigger in terms of the type of being (for example, the caster could generally specify "the spell will be triggered by the touch of a living creature" and have a yard full of glass squirrels, or "the spell activates if a humanoid touches it," saving the wildlife from a glassy fate) or material ("the spell will activate if leather contacts this window," "all metals will trigger the spell"). Ifa material is mentioned in the casting, only the specified material is affected, making it possible for a thief to shatter her armor while breaking in through a window or a glassy spy to fall to his death, leaving some nice magical items behind. This spell can be countered by Duhlark''s glassremove.
The material component for this spell is some sand or a small piece of glass.
Notes: Restricted to Dulark and his apprentices; very rare.

Duhlark's Long Reach
(Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Range: 25 yds. + 5 yds /level
Components: V, S,M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 5 rds_/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 arm
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a magical arm out of materials present in the area of effect. The arm can form from any surface—for example, from a wall or from the ground—creatinga large arm of wood, packed dirt, or stone. The arm can be normal man-sized or it can be up to gargantuan size (3 feet long, plus the caster's level in feet maximum). Once formed, the long reach arm is rooted to its original creation point and limited to its specific size.
Its primary purpose is to grab and hold objects, persons, or creatures. It grabs at a creature selected by the wizard, attacking with the wi: ard's THAC0 and a +2 bonus. It holds any prey grasped with the equivalent of 19 Strength, regardless of size. The arm can punch down walls and doors (striking like a battering ram) and it can make an attack roll to punch opponents for 2d6 points of damage. Like spectral hand, touchdelivered spells cast by the controlling wizard can be projected through an existing magical arm.
The magical arm is under the control of the caster and can be used for purposes beyond capture and attack; the caster cannot, while controlling the arm, perform any other actions. If the wizard performs any other activity, the arm freezes in its last position until the wizard exerts control.
If created of wood, the arm has an AC of 4, while a stone arm has an AC of 0; the arm's hit points are equal to the wizard's. The arm collapses back into its raw material and disappears when it is reduced to 0 hit points.
While created by Duhlark the Transmuter, a wizard of Waterdeep, this spell is known for its use by watch-wizards and is often referred to as the "Long Arm of the Law." In the hands of the watch-wizards, this spell performs many functions, like catching fleeing felons, battering down doors, halting runaway wagons, tossing Dock Ward rowdies into the harbor, and even stretching to rescue children trapped in burning buildings before pulling the burning wreck down. Duhlark is proud to see his spell in good use, but he grows furious if people don't use its "proper title, not a populist caricature of a name!"
The material components for the spell are a small piece of wood or stone and a pinch of sulphur.
Notes: Restricted to Dulark, the Wizard's Guild, and the Watch of Waterdeep; common.

Dune — Old Empire
(Conjuration)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 4
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: Creates 1 sand dune
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard creates a magical sand dune that can carry one man-sized creature per two levels of experience of the caster through any sandy area (for example, three creatures at 7th level, four at 8th and 9th level, five at 10th and 1 Ith, and so on). This dune can move at a rate of 4 per level of the spellcaster but only through sandy areas. It has a maximum movement rate of 48,
The material component for this spell is a pinch of sand.
Notes: Uncommon spell. As a FORGOTTEN REALMS Old Empire spell, initial exposure requires a mentor or a read Southern magic spell.

Duo-Dimension
(Alteration)
(Dimension, Shadow)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 7
Duration: 3 rds. + 1 rd./level
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
A duo-dimension spell causes the caster to have only two dimensions, height and width, with no depth. He is thus invisible when turned sideways. This invisibility can be detected only by means of a frue seeing spell or similar methods. In addition, the duo-dimensional wizard can pass through the thinnest of spaces as long as these have the proper height—going through the space between a door and its frame is a simple matter. The wizard can perform all actions normally. He can turn and become invisible, move in this state, and appear again next round and cast a spell, disappearing on the following round.
Note that when turned, the wizard cannot be affected by any form of attack, but when visible, he is subject to double the amount of damage normal for an attack form; for example, a dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of damage if it struck a duo-dimensional wizard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion of his existence in the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect, and he is subject to possible notice by creatures there. If noticed, it is 25% probable that the wizard is pulled entirely into the Astral Plane by any attack from an astral creature. Such an attack (and any subsequent attack received on the Astral Plane) inflicts normal damage.
The material components of this spell are a flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which must be of finest workmanship, gold filigreed, and enameled and gem-studded at an average cost of 500 to 1,000 gp) anda strip of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the parchment is given halfa twist and joined at the ends. The figurine is then passed through the parchment loop, and both disappear forever.
Notes: Common spell (PHB).

Duplicate
(Conjuration)
(Artifice)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr/level
Area of Effect: Object touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates an exact copy of any single item the caster touches. The item to be copied must fit inside a 20-foot cube. The spell has no effect on living creatures or undead, nor will it copy magical items. The duplicated item is identical to the original in every way—for instance, a duplicated sword can be wielded to inflict damage as a normal sword—but detect magic can reveal its true nature and dispel magic can cause it to disappear. The duplicated object exists for 1 hour per level of the caster, at which time it vanishes; a permanency spell does not affect duplicated items.
The material component for this spell is a pinch of coal dust.
Notes: Uncommon spell.

Dust Curtain
(Evocation)
(Province: Sand) ar
Level: 2
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 2
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: 20-ft. cube/level
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a controlled gale that lifts a large amount of sand and dust from the ground and shapes it in the air. The caster must choose between two basic forms—a dust wall, or a blinding dust cloud that resembles a sandstorm. The former might be used to conceal the caster's allies. The latter usually surrounds his foes.
Once the shape is chosen, it can't be changed. Within a round, the spell creates a wind strong enough to shape the cloud or wall to its full volume. The wind is not strong enough to cause damage, however. Creatures surrounded by a cloud fight as if they're in total darkness, with a 4 penalty to their attack rolls. Individuals with the blind fighting proficiency are not affected, however. Missile weapons fired into, out of, or through either the cloud or sand wall suffer a —1 penalty-assuming the target can still be seen. Spellcasting is not affected by the dust curtain, except for reduced visibility.
The caster must concentrate continuously to maintain the dust curtain. If the caster's concentration is broken, the cloud or wall of dust collapses and dissipates one round later. The same thing occurs after the caster is injured, dies, begins any spellcasting, becomes unconscious, or moves out of range of the cloud.
While concentration is maintained, the caster can move the dust wall or cloud up to 10 yards horizontally and 10 yards vertically each round. A dispel magic spell will cause the dust curtain to collapse—as will any other magic that controls or creates winds (even a friendly effort, intended to move the curtain along).
A spellcaster creating a cloud with this spell is not limited to an amorphous mass. He can shape the dust into a djinni, a dragon, a mass of tentacles—whatever suits him. Like the other forms, this must be selected upon casting, and cannot be changed afterward. Such shapes are a matter of style; the effects remain the same as any cloud, and cannot be mistaken for the real thing. The dust curtain can be cast only in an area with significant dust, sand, or loose soil to support a dust storm. The dusty earth of a village street is sufficient. Also suitable are a desert, a beach, or a tomb that has not been disturbed for ages. But the stone of a city street won't work, nor will an outcropping of solid rock or a jungle growth. The wizard casts the spell with a whispered incantation.
The material component is a handful of sand, blown from the caster's hand.
Notes: Uncommon in an arabian setting; otherwise very rare.

Dusts of Death
(Alteration)
(Alchemy)
Level: 6
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Duration: 1 hr.
Area of Effect: A pinch of sand
Saving Throw: Neg.
The dusts of death spell turns a pinch of sand into an incredibly toxic poison. The envenomed sand cannot be detected by any normal means, though detect magic or detect poison will reveal the presence of this spell.
If the sand is introduced into food and drink, it will surely be ingested. Whoever consumes the sand must save vs. spell or die instantly. The only clue as to the reason for the victim's demise is a small dusting of sand around the edges of the victim's mouth and nostrils.
Sorcerous societies are fond of using this as a method of assassination, and the secret of the spell is jealously guarded.
Notes: Restricted to members of sorcerous societies; uncommon in arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Dweomer Vortex — Phaerimm
(Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: 10 yds.
Components: V
Casting Time: 3
Duration: Special
Area of Effect: Cone, 10 ft. long, 4-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates a shimmering conical field in midair, its small end towards the caster, and its circular open end of 4-foot radius size. The cone moves in response to the wielder's thought, floating freely through the air at a rate of up to 6. It is stopped by solid barriers, which it won't affect but can't pass through. If the cone encounters magical areas of effect (including not-yet-triggered magical traps), it whirls, flashes, and "drinks" them.
A dweomer vortex can drain up to six spell levels; it can destroy six Ist-level spells, or any combination of spells up toa total of six spell levels, before vanishing in a harmless, spectacular whirl of winking lights. A spell exceeding these limits is destroyed as the vortex collapses.
A dweomer vortex is not ended or affected by its caster casting other spells or using magical items. A dispel magic spell causes it to collapse while absorbing the entire effect of the dispel magic spell.
Dweomer vortices can't affect antimagic shells, globes of invulnerability, or any prismatic spell of 3rd level or higher. It does not affect astral silver cords. On contact they destroy, and are destroyed by, minor globes of invulnerability. These vortices do not transmit "drained" spells or spell energy to the caster.
Notes: Restricted to Phaerimm; common.

Dweomerdeny
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 8
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 8
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 1 spellcaster
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell banishes a particular spell forever from the mind and comprehension of a spellcasting being. To enact it, the caster must touch the target creature while speaking an incantation. A successful attack roll is required to touch unwilling beings. If the recipient is not a spellcaster, the spell is wasted. A touched spellcaster must make a successful saving throw vs. spell at a -6 penalty.
If the saving throw succeeds, the chosen spell vanishes from the mindof the target if it is currently memorized. The spell is lost, but the target takes no harm, If no such spell is in memory, the spell has no effect at all. The spell targeted may be specific, known, and named, or just whatever magic was used to produce a particular spell effect that the caster of the dweomerdeny has personally witnessed.
If the saving throw fails, all memory of the spell is gone forever, both any currently memorized enchantments and all memories of learning them and using them. Moreover, the victim's mind is never able to comprehend the particular spell again. It cannot be learned, memorized, or even read from a scroll by the victim. Limited wish, restoration, and wish spells are the only known ways of reversing this loss.
A dweomerdeny works only against a specific spell, not against all spells of a school or type. For instance, it could be cast so as to prevent a wizard from using fireball, but that prohibition would not extend to flaming sphere or meteor swarm.
Notes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their apprentices, and select Harpers; rare.
